{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module introduces techniques through which dynamic environmental conditions can be measured and monitored and provides a basis for reasoned debates about issues related to environmental change. Students following the module can expect to be tutored in a number of techniques that may include (depending upon expertise of staff who are available to teach the module) geomorphic hazard mapping, micro-meteorology, palaeoecology and remote sensing. The module goes on to discuss the implications to humans of past and present environmental dynamism and of predicted environmental changes. Among the topics for student-led discussions in this part of the module are the dialectic of global climate change; the contribution of urban areas to global climate change; possible relationships between biodiversity and environmental instability; and inequalities in the degree of human vulnerability. A seminar presentation focusing on the relevance of the module to their thesis or on thesis topic is expected.", "title": "Dynamic Environments", "department": "Geography", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [1, 2, 0, 5, 2], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GE5211", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 15, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
