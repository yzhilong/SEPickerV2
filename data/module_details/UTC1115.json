This module helps students develop basic insights into the workings of selected engineering applications. Coupled to this is an investigation of the engineering marvel \u2018in context\u2019. What problems or issues does it address? What are its costs and consequences \u2013 both intended and unintended? What are the ethical and political dimensions of this? Each run of the module will have a specific thematic focus, such as big structures, biotechnologies, or robotics.", "title": "Junior Seminar Engineering Marvels", "department": "Tembusu College", "faculty": "Residential College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UTC1115", "semesterData": []}
