{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module focuses on synthetic strategies for the construction and synthesis of new bioactive small molecules with potential therapeutic properties. It also\ncovers topics in peptide and oligonucleotide syntheses which are fundamental in the production of some small sized biologics. The module supplements knowledge in medicinal chemistry to give students an appreciation on how to manipulate molecules through chemical synthesis to achieve better bioactivity.", "title": "Synthetic Strategies for Drug Substances", "department": "Pharmacy", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [4, 0.5, 3, 0, 2.5], "prerequisite": "PR1110/PR1110A Foundations for Medicinal Chemistry or PHS1110 Foundation for Medicinal and Synthetic Chemistry.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PHS4220", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["PR1110", "PR1110A", "PHS1110"]}}
