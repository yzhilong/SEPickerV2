{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Although diverse in scale and nature, the dynamics of tsunamis, the formation and breaking of chemical bonds, the development of stripes on a zebra, the transmission of nerve impulses, and the precession of binary pulsars are natural phenomena that can be described and understood in terms of waves. We will discuss the nature of waves by starting with the idea that a wave is simply a disturbance that propagates in a medium via the interaction of its parts. Using the above and other phenomena, we examine what we can learn about matter from the various kinds of waves.  We will also trace the important steps in scientific thinking that has taken the idea of a wave from a mere description of empirical observations to the abstract but powerfully predictive concept of a quantum wave.", "title": "Waves in Nature", "department": "University Scholars Programme", "faculty": "University Scholars Programme", "workload": [2, 2, 0, 2, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UNL2205", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
