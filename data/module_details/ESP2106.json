{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The primary objective of the module is to develop a fundamental understanding of how to formulate the governing equations of continua with the aid of basic conservation laws of physics that govern the behaviour of a continuum. An allied objective is to apply the governing equations to simplified as well as industrially-relevant problems in solid mechanics and fluid mechanics. Overall, this course provides a foundation for the role of continuum mechanics in engineering and science.", "title": "Principles of Continua", "department": "Engineering Science Programme", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "PC1433", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ESP2106", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E1-06-07", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E5-03-19", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E5-03-19", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": "PC1433"}
