{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The human brain is the most complex structure in the known universe, with large areas responsible for processing visual information. In this module, we adopt an interdisciplinary approach to studying the human visual system as a model for understanding the functional organization of the brain. We begin with how photons are converted into neural synaptic potentials. Next, we explore the anatomical and physiological organization of the cortical visual areas, as well as computational models of their function. We then review the psychophysical studies of object recognition and visual attention. We conclude by studying mathematical models used in artificial vision systems.", "title": "Vision and Perception", "department": "Integrative Science and Engineering Program", "faculty": "NUS Graduate School", "workload": [3, 2, 5, 0, 8], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GS6004", "semesterData": []}
