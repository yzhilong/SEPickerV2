{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course covers a number of topics beginning with a treatment the properties, heat and work transfers of real gases vapours. The module focuses on the sub-systems related to energy efficient systems such as cogeneration. The major topics are the design procedure of heat exchangers, performance of absorption refrigeration systems. Two main topics under cogeneration are introduced. These are microturbine cogeneration and biomass cogeneration. The students are provided with the status of these technologies, and provided with the technical, financial and environmental performance. Case studies of cogeneration plants found locally and regionally provide students with actual operating experience.", "title": "Energy and Thermal Systems", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0.5, 0, 2, 4.5], "prerequisite": "ME2121", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME4226", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-24T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": "ME2121"}
