{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module is the first of a set of two modules: Engineering Principle and Practice I and II (EPP I and EPP II). EPP modules aim to introduce first year students to the biomedical engineer\u2019s way of thinking and addressing problems. A real-life medical technology will be used to demonstrate the fundamental knowledge and skills that a biomedical engineer is expected to possess. In EPP I, students will be exposed to key engineering problems such as how to analyse a complex medical \ntechnology, how to design and fabricate a prototype and how to predict failure.", "title": "Engineering Principles and Practice I", "department": "Biomedical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [6, 2, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "6", "moduleCode": "BN1101", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
