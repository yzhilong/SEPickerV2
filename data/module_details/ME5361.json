{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This is an advanced module on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) at the graduate level. The module introduces some newly-developed numerical techniques for simulation of fluid flows as well as convective heat transfer problems. Major topics covered in this module include: high-order numerical approaches for solving boundary-layer and Navier-Stokes equations; boundary integral method for linear systems; upwind and Godunov-type schemes for compressible flow simulation; lattice Boltzmann method for incompressible flow simulation. There is a compulsory Term Paper project for this module. The module is recommended for research students and engineers who intend to do research project in the CFD area.", "title": "Advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME5361", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
