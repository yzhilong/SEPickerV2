{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module is the first of two introductory modules focusing on supervised machine learning algorithms and techniques. Students will be taught to analyse datasets, perform necessary transformations, build machine learning models to derive insights, and evaluate and subsequently make adjustments to fine-tune models appropriately. Topics include regression & gradient descent, theory of generalisation and VC dimensions, kernel models and Support Vector Machines, decision trees, and time series forecasting, with discussion on application into various engineering use cases.", "title": "Statistical Learning in Engineering I", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "IE5602", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
