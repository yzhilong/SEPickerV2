{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module introduces practical, real-world genomic data analysis: when a genomic experiment is performed, and bioinformatics analysis is required, how is it done? In \u201cData Access and Integration\u201d, students will learn how to distinguish databases and integrate data. In \u201cGenomics and NGS\u201d, students will learn practical analysis of microarray and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Students will learn how to map sequencing data to genomes in a variety of problem settings and interpret results. In \u201cIntegrative Analysis\u201d, students will learn how approaches including pathway analysis and analysis of gene regulatory networks can add power to interpretation of genomic experiments.", "title": "Genomic Data Analysis", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 1, 2, 3, 2], "prerequisite": "[LSM2232 (Genes, Genomes & Biomedical Implications) AND either CS1010S (Programming Methodology) or equivalent or LSM2253 (Applied Data Analysis in Ecology and Evolution)] \nOR LSM2241 (Introductory Bioinformatics) \nOR CS2220 (Introduction to Computational Biology)", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LSM3241", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 40, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": [{"and": ["LSM2232", {"or": ["CS1010S", "LSM2253"]}]}, "LSM2241", "CS2220"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["LSM4241", "LSM4254", "ZB4171"]}
