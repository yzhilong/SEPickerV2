{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The objective of this module is to equip participants with fundamental approaches in designing structural concrete components and systems. The participants will learn refined methods in the design for action effects and for deflection and crack control, and in the structural detailing of concrete members. The module is targeted at civil engineers and those with a keen interest on advanced structural concrete design.", "title": "Structural Concrete Design to EC2", "department": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [1, 0, 0, 0.5, 3.5], "prerequisite": "Background in Structural Mechanics and Analysis", "moduleCredit": "2", "moduleCode": "CE5510A", "attributes": {"lab": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [1, 2], "venue": "LT2", "day": "Saturday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": {"start": "2021-01-08", "end": "2021-01-08"}, "venue": "LT2", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4], "venue": "EA-06-05", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
