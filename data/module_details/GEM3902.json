Unlike a UROP, where the student contributes to an existing research project, an ISM is an individual study \nprogramme conceptualized by the student. ISMs undertaken at CAPT must be inter-disciplinary, multidisciplinary, or trans-disciplinary in topic and/or approach. \nStudent and supervisor need to submit for approval an ISM contract that gives a clear account of the topic, programme of study, evaluation, and other pertinent \ndetails. The ISM is a graded module.", "title": "Independent Study", "department": "College of Alice and Peter Tan", "faculty": "Residential College", "workload": [0, 0, 0, 0, 10], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GEM3902", "attributes": {"ism": true}, "semesterData": []}
