{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module covers the principles of statistics in relation to biophysics and bio soft materials. It focuses on: modeling of biomacromolecular structure and statistical complexities; molecular mechanics of biomolecules; statistical models for structural transitions in biopolymers, statistical physical  description of structural transitions in macromolecules,  simulation of macromolecular structure, structural transitions in polypeptides and proteins; coil-helix transitions; prediction of protein secondary and tertiary structures; statistics of structural transitions in  polynucleotides and DNA; modeling of non-regular structures of biomacromolecules. This module is targeted at both physics and non-physics students who already have basic knowledge in physics, thermodynamics and molecular biology.", "title": "Biophysics III", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 1, 2, 3], "prerequisite": "Students who have passed either PC3267 or Departmental Approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PC4267", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-25T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": "PC3267"}
