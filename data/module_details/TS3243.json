{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module explores the many ways in which theatre and film are distinct but closely inter-related mediums. The bulk of the module focuses on close analysis of texts that have been adapted from the stage to the screen, examining performativity within those texts and how the essential properties that define the stage and the screen contribute to and facilitate particular ways for performing such texts. Notions of theatricality and the cinema will be interrogated, especially in relation to how cinema can be \u2018theatrical\u2019 and the theatre \u2018cinematic\u2019. Teaching and assessment modes include lectures, seminars, workshops and guided practical coursework.", "title": "Stage and Screen", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "TS3243", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1500", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
