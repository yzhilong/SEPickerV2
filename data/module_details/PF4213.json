{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module discusses the main concepts and applications of building energy simulation. The main focus of the module is on design decision support using simulation tools to evaluate the impact of different passive designs and active systems. We will also review various key performance indicators, such as peak loads, energy consumption, thermal, and visual comfort. Students will also learn about the energy modelling methodology for Green Mark.", "title": "Building Energy Analysis and Simulation", "department": "Building", "faculty": "Design and Environment", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PF4213", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
