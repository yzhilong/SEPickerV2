{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module offers an introduction to key issues in Korean politics. We cover the politics of both regimes on the Korean Peninsula, as well as inter-Korean relations. Although the module focuses on the domestic politics of Korea, the peninsula's politics cannot be understood without reference to the broader regional and international context.
