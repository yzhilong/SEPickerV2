{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module provides an introduction on the innovation & product development processes that materials scientists and engineers are likely to face in their future workplaces. This course will be conducted with a mixture of MSE relevant case-studies and experiential group learning. Students will start from the pre-development process: building up their problem statements, ideation and developing their minimum viable product (product concept) by considering the technical feasibility, business viability as well as customer desirability; and then followed by development and manufacturing processes: i.e. samples development, test & certification, production etc. Continuous improvement upon product development will also be introduced.", "title": "Innovation & Product Development for Material Engineers", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 2, 5], "prerequisite": "MLE2104 Mechanical Properties of Materials", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MLE4213", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 85, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": "MLE2104"}
