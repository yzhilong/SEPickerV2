{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Designed as an introductory theoretical module, it covers the basic concepts of International Relations in two halves. The first introduces the concepts of nation, state, sovereignty, non-state actors and their implications for the coexistence of nation-states, as well as a brief roundup of the instruments of conducting relations among them. The other offers a grounding in the major schools of thought on International Relations, namely realism, liberalism/pluralism and revolutionism. Additionally, there will be topics on radical perspectives such as feminism, constructivism and postmodernism. It is hoped the module will provide students with a foundation for other courses in the sub-field.", "title": "Introduction to International Relations", "department": "Political Science", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 2, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PS2237", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "D2", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 150, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "E3", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "D3", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "E1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "D1", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "E2", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-24T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "fulfillRequirements": ["PS3251", "PS3880F"]}
