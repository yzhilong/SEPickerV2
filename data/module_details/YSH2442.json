{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Energy and environment are likely to be key themes that will dominate the way science and engineering develop over the next few decades. This course introduces different sources of alternative energy and the scientific basis behind climate change \u2013 the problem that drives the whole alternative energy project \u2013 and provides some fundamental concepts about solar energy utilization strategies in natural and artificial photosynthesis. The principles of light harvesting, charge separation and fuel production revealed by studies of the natural photosynthetic systems will be presented and related to artificial photoelectrochemical processes.", "title": "Alternative Energy", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 12, 0, 0, 24], "moduleCredit": "1", "moduleCode": "YSH2442", "semesterData": []}
