This course examines the living, legal and media conditions that led to the reframing of nudities, and the subsequent censorship guidelines governing the presentation and representation of nudity in the arts. The sources explore the linguistic, philosophical, artistic, and faith inheritances that constructed the term \u2018nudity\u2019, and consider the many fictions, as well as real-world consequences, these readings of nudities have to offer.", "title": "Arts in Singapore: Skinning Nudities in the 1990s\u20132010s", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3.5, 6], "prerequisite": "Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
