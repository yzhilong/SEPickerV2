This module provides a unique action-learning experience that assembles cross-disciplinary teams to work on identifying technological solutions for specific pre-selected real problems in the emerging markets and from industry. The intent is to create minimum viable organisations or propose and demonstrate solutions for enterprises. Students learn to lead innovation which involves creating more value with less resources.", "title": "Frugal Innovation", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MT5912", "attributes": {"grsu": true, "lab": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E2-03-32", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [12], "venue": "UTSRC-LT52", "day": "Saturday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
