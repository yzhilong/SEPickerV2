Only when algorithms and technology are applied to meaningful problems or hypotheses can useful information be extracted from data for making decisions. This module is conducted as a series of hackathons: data scientists from partnering organisations in the public policy and society sector provide the real-world situations and data which will enable students to gain practical experience in (i) formulating problems, (ii) solving them by applying, or developing and implementing, appropriate data-analytic tools and techniques, and (iii) communicating findings and insights gained clearly.", "title": "Sense-making Case Analysis: Public Policy and Society", "department": "Statistics and Applied Probability", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 4, 3], "prerequisite": "CS3244 Machine Learning and DSA3101 Data Science in Practice, or by permission", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "DSA4264", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CS3244", "DSA3101"]}}
