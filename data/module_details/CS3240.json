{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course is intended for students in computing and related disciplines whose work focuses on human-computer interaction issues in the design of computer systems. The course stresses the importance of user-centred design and usability in the development of computer applications and systems. Students will be taken through the analysis, design, development, and evaluation of human-computer interaction methods for computer systems. They will acquire hands-on design skills through laboratory exercises and assignments. The course also covers HCI design principles and emphasizes the importance of contextual, organisational, and social factors in system design.", "title": "Interaction Design", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 1, 1, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "(CS1020 or its equivalent) or CS2020 or (CS2030 or its equivalent) or CS2113/T or NM3209 or NM2207/Y", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS3240", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 200, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 120, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 120, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["CS1020", "CS2020", "CS2030", "CS2113", "CS2113T", "NM3209", "NM2207", "NM2207Y"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["CS4249", "CS6206", "CS3283", "CS5346"]}
