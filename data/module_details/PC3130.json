{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module continues from PC2130 and completes the basic formation of the student in quantum mechanics. Description of composite systems: tensor product, two-particle entanglement; systems of N identical particles. Perturbation theory: time-independent, both non-degenerate and degenerate; example: Zeeman effect. Time-dependent: Fermi golden rule; example: atom in a classical e-m field. Discussion of stimulated and spontaneous emission.\nOther approximation schemes: the variational principle; the WKB approximation and the \u201cclassical\u201d region, tunneling and the connecting formula; the adiabatic approximation. Scattering: partial wave analysis and the Born approximation.", "title": "Quantum Mechanics II", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "Students who have passed either PC2130 or PC2130B, and PC2134 or equivalent", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PC3130", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 120, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 120, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": [{"or": ["PC2130", "PC2130B"]}, "PC2134"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["PC4130", "PC3243", "PC4246", "PC4259", "PC4230", "PC5228", "PC5203", "PC5210", "PC5201", "PC4228", "PC4245", "QT5101", "QT5201V"]}
