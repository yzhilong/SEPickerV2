In addition, filmed versions of the texts are considered where appropriate and available. The module therefore will explore texts both in their own right and as representative examples of major tendencies and developments of an essentially European tradition.", "title": "European Literature I", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 4, 3], "prerequisite": "(i) EN1101E AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)", "corequisite": "So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E/GEK1000, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207).", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EU3217", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"and": ["EN1101E", {"or": ["EN2201", "EN2202", "EN2203", "EN2204", "EN2205", "EN2207", "EN2275", "EN2276", "EN2277"]}]}}
