We shall begin by defining the areas of concern in human factors engineering (e.g., the humanmachine\ninterface, the displays to be perceived, and the controls to be actuated). We shall\ndiscuss also the tools and methodologies used by a human factors engineer. The latter portion of the subject will discuss issues of capabilities and limitations of the human operator.", "title": "Humans and Systems Engineering", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [25, 42, 14, 14, 35], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SYE5301", "semesterData": []}
