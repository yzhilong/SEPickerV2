{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "In Southeast Asia, the global Cold War coincided with the decolonization process when newly-emerging independent nations were eager to seek powerful international allies and vice versa. As long-term sojourners and settlers in the region, the Chinese migrants and their local-born descendants arguably saw the height of the Cold War as the most challenging period. Although they have experienced creolization and acculturation in their country of destination and birth, their allegiances became suspect after China came under the communist rule. This course examines the policies and experiences of ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia during the Cold War and its aftermath.", "title": "Cold War and the Chinese in Southeast Asia", "department": "Chinese Studies", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2, 5], "prerequisite": "Graduate students in Chinese Studies, or 120 MCs (or equivalent) and permission of Department.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CH6247", "semesterData": []}
