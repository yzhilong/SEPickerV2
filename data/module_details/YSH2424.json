{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Introduction of black holes, first with a brief review of theory, then with\nmore emphasis on observations, including stellar-mass black hole\ncandidates in our galaxy, the very massive black hole at the center of our\nMilky Way galaxy, and the super-massive black holes now understood to be\nat the centers of nearly every galaxy. We will learn about astronomical data\nthat constrain the history of the growth of super-massive black holes across\nthe last 12 billion years of cosmic history. Finally, we will consider the\npossible role of black hole growth in galaxy evolution.", "title": "Black Holes Across the Cosmos", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 12, 0, 0, 24], "moduleCredit": "1", "moduleCode": "YSH2424", "semesterData": []}
