{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The Greek and Roman classics and the Bible are recognized as having exerted profound influence on the development of Western literature and culture. Familiarity with the classical and Judeo-Christian traditions helps tremendously in enabling appreciation of Western literature and culture. This module introduces students to selected works from these two traditions such as Homer\u2019s Odyssey, Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus the King, and the Book of Genesis and the Gospel of John from the Bible. Through close readings, students become acquainted with the worldview, ideas and motifs in these key works. Some attention will be given to developing writing skills through essay assignments.", "title": "Backgrounds to Western Literature and Culture", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2, 5], "prerequisite": "EN1101E", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EN2201", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 40, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 40, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": "EN1101E", "fulfillRequirements": ["EN3223", "EN3231", "AS3231", "EN3252", "EN3261", "EU3217", "EN3268", "EN3246", "GEM3003", "EN3251", "EN3227", "EN3229", "EN3232", "AS3232", "EN3234", "AS3234", "EN3244", "EN3880B", "EN3222", "EN3249", "EN3263", "EN3224", "EN3276", "EN3221", "EN3226", "EN3228", "EN3241", "EN3247", "EN3262", "EN3264", "EN3266", "EN3267", "EN3269", "EN3272", "EN3243", "EN3220"]}
