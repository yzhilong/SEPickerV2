{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "It is increasingly clear that a full appreciation of the chemical and physical properties that govern individual cells is essential for the understanding of development and disease. Emphasis will also be placed on reading primary research publications.\n\nThis module is designed to expose students to topics such as cell cycle control, cell polarization, membrane trafficking, actin and microtubular cytoskeleton, and cellular mechanisms contributing to disease.  A biochemical and Biophysical view of the cell and its functions will be explored.  In addition to the lectures, the students have time for critical discussion sessions with the lecturers, many of whom are pioneers in the topics being covered in the course.\n\nIntended for fresh or advanced graduate students familiar with basic cell biology", "title": "Cellular Mechanisms", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 3, 0, 0, 4], "prerequisite": "A strong foundation in life sciences and molecular biology", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BL5222", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}]}
