{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Software evolution refers to the study and management of the process of making changes to software over time. Therefore, it comprises maintenance, enhancement and re-engineering activities.\n\nOver several decades, studies have shown that 75% of software personnel spend their time on activities involving software evolution, which comprise 50% of IT costs. Hence, these activities constitute a significant proportion of work performed by most software professionals during their careers.\n\nThe aim of this course is to teach a systematic approach to software maintenance and evolution. The course will not only discuss the engineering aspects, but also the applicable management practices.", "title": "Software Maintenance and Evolution", "department": "Institute of Systems Science", "faculty": "Institute of Systems Science", "workload": [1.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3, 2], "prerequisite": "The course pre-requisite would be a professional competency in a contemporary programming language such as C#, Java or C++.", "moduleCredit": "3", "moduleCode": "SG5229", "semesterData": []}
