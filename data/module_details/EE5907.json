The main objectives of this graduate module are to equip students with knowledge of common statistical pattern recognition (PR) algorithms and techniques. Course will contain project-based work involving use of PR algorithms. Upon completion of this module, students will be able to analyze a given pattern recognition problem, and determine which standard technique is applicable, or be able to modify existing algorithms to engineer new algorithms to solve the problem. Topics covered include: Decision theory, Parameter estimation, Density estimation, Non-parametric techniques, Supervised learning, Dimensionality reduction, Linear discriminant functions, Clustering, Unsupervised learning, Feature extraction and Applications.", "title": "Pattern Recognition", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2.75, 0, 0, 2, 5.25], "prerequisite": "[applicable to UG level students only] EE2012 or EE2012A or ST2334 or EE3731C or CS1101S; or\n\n[Advisory applicable to GD level students only] Requires background knowledge in probability/statistics, programming (python/matlab) and linear algebra that are typically covered in an undergraduate engg program", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE5907", "attributes": {"grsu": true, "mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 170, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-27T06:30:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["EE2012", "EE2012A", "ST2334", "EE3731C", "CS1101S"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["EE6903", "EE6733", "EE5934", "EE6934"]}
