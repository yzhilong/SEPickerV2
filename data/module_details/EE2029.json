{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EE3506C - Introduction to Electrical Energy Systems", "description": "This module covers the fundamental principles of modern\nelectrical energy systems; including three-phase analysis,\nelectric generations, electric loads, and power electronic\nconverters. Students will learn how to analyse, model, and\npredict the performance of energy systems and devices\nincluding single-phase and three-phase systems,\ntransformers, and various types of generators. Students\nwill develop a broad systems perspective and an\nunderstanding of the principal elements of electrical\nenergy systems. This will serve as the foundation of\nhigher-level topics in power engineering. Furthermore,\nlectured materials are relevant to PE exams for preparing\nstudents to work effectively in complex electrical\nengineering problems.", "title": "Introduction to Electrical Energy Systems", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2.5, 0.5, 1, 0, 3.5], "prerequisite": "EE2111A Electrical Engineering Principles and Practice II\n/ EE1112 Engineering Principles and Practice II /\nEG1112 Engineering Principles and Practice II /\nCG1111 Engineering Principles and Practice I", "moduleCredit": "3", "moduleCode": "EE2029", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Packaged Tutorial", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Packaged Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-25T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Packaged Tutorial", "size": 160, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Packaged Lecture", "size": 160, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2021-05-03T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["EE2111A", "EE1112", "EG1112", "CG1111"]}}
