{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Many chemical companies are moving towards higher value-added specialty chemical products from commodities. This module prepares students with the\nexpertise of (higher-value-added) chemical product design for such  companies. It covers the basic methodology with illustrative examples from many areas such as active ingredients and personal-care products. The module involves active-learning lectures and student teaching (with feedback from the lecturer and peers) so that students will gain competence of thinking divergently and critically, and confidently solving open-ended problems through group discussion.", "title": "Chemical Product Design", "department": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2.5, 1, 0, 3.5, 3], "prerequisite": "CN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN3132: Separation Processes\nCN3135: Process Safety, Health and Environment", "corequisite": "EG2401/EG2401A: Engineering Professionalism", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CN4250", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CN2116", "CN3132", "CN3135"]}}
