{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The objective of this module is to provide students a working knowledge of computer performance evaluation and capacity planning. They will be able to identify performance bottlenecks, to predict when performance limits of a system will be exceeded, and to characterise present and future workload to perform capacity planning activities. Topics include: performance analysis overview; measurement techniques and  tools including workload characterisation, instrumentation, benchmarking, analytical modelling techniques including operational analysis, stochastic queuing network analysis; performance of client-server architectures; capacity planning; case studies.", "title": "Computer System Performance Analysis", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "((CS1020 or its equivalent) or CS2020 or (CS2030 or its equivalent) or CS2113/T) and (EE2012/A or ST2132 or ST2334 or ((MA2216 or ST2131) and (ST1131/A or ST1232 or DSC2008)))", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS5239", "attributes": {"lab": true, "mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 105, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 105, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": [{"or": ["CS1020", "CS2020", "CS2030", "CS2113", "CS2113T"]}, {"or": ["EE2012", "EE2012A", "ST2132", "ST2334", {"and": [{"or": ["MA2216", "ST2131"]}, {"or": ["ST1131", "ST1131A", "ST1232", "DSC2008"]}]}]}]}}
