Conflict interfaces with mutual\ndependence naturally, and decision making in such situations requires one to take into account the moves and countermoves among them. This module provides a\nrigorous non-cooperative game theoretic view for managers to analyse rational decision makings under various conjectural behaviours in such strategic interactions together with strategic moves to possibly influence the outcome for one\u2019s own or mutual gains. Fundamental theory will be well balanced with economic, managerial and personal decision making situation applications. Game experiments will be performed as well.", "title": "Game Theory For Managers", "department": "BIZ Dean's Office", "faculty": "NUS Business School", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BMS5117", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "BIZ1-0302", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 46, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
