What makes a director an auteur?  What cultural and/or ideological implications reside in the development, alteration or evolution of an auteur's style?", "title": "Narrative, Narration, Auteur", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN, or 28 MCs in TS, and EN2203, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "EN4245", "semesterData": []}
