{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module uses a life course approach to studying gender issues and their implications for social work practice. Three broad phases of the life course are examined: childhood and adolescence, mid-life, and old age. For each phase, the major issues affecting women that have implications for micro-level and macro-level social work practice will be examined. As there are some issues (e.g. role stereotypes) that recur over different phases of life, they will be examined over the life course.", "title": "Gender Issues in Social Work Practice", "department": "Social Work", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 1, 6], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SW3206", "semesterData": []}
