{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module provides an introduction to the theory of general relativity. The topics covered are: general tensor analysis, the Riemann tensor, the gravitational field equation, the Schwarzschild solution, experimental tests of general relativity, black holes, and Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models of the expanding universe. While this module is mainly targeted at physics majors, it is also suitable for science students with a strong mathematical foundation.", "title": "General Relativity", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 1, 5], "prerequisite": "Students who have passed PC3274 or Departmental Approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PC4248", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": "PC3274", "fulfillRequirements": ["PC4232"]}
