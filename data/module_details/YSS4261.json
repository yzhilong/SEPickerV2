{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course introduces students to psychological anthropology. We probe the cultural assumptions underpinning theories of the mind and consider how anthropology contributes to scholarship on the psyche and its workings. We begin by examining the relationships between the psyche, the body, and power through engaging with conversations in cross-cultural psychology, psychoanalysis, black existentialism, and feminist and queer theory. Next, we ground our analysis in ethnographies by anthropologists who are also practicing psychiatrists, therapists, and social workers. Addressing such topics as madness, addiction, and possession, we examine the interrelationships between power, politics, and intimate experience.", "title": "Psychological Anthropology", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0.5, 9], "prerequisite": "YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS4261", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1930", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-LT1", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1930", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-LT1", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": "YCC2121"}
