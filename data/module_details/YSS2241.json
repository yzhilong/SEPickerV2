{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course looks at political parties, movements and currents of activism in predominantly democratic capitalist countries which can be labeled in some sense Left-wing. The term \"Left\" does not lend itself to easy definition, and we will discuss its meaning throughout the course. The first part focuses upon types of Left that were dominant for most of the 20th century including Social Democracy, Communism, Socialism and the Third Way. The second part of the course looks at newer forms of Left, including new social movements (environmental and peace movements), contemporary anarchism, identity-based politics, and the emergence of radical anti-austerity parties.", "title": "Contemporary Left Politics and Movements", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3.5, 6], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS2241", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-CR17", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-CR17", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
