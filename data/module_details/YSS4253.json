{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Anthropologists have long argued against the radical separation of theory and method. Not only does ethnographic observation shape the knowledge it produces; anthropology\u2019s commitment to an intersubjective world determines the kind of embedded observation, \u201cthick description\u201d and \u201cgrounded theory\u201d that are its stock-in-trade. But what are ethnography and grounded theory in our late modern world, when many of the humanist assumptions on which anthropology was founded have come under critique - feminist, Marxist, queer, and postcolonial? Drawing on ethnographies past and present, this class will explore these questions through a close engagement with ethnographic texts, past and present.", "title": "Ethnography as Theory and Method: Classical and Contemporary Readings", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS4253", "semesterData": []}
