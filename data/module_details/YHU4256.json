{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course undertakes an in-depth study of the concept, value, and practices of solidarity in connection with social change. What different things are meant by \u201csolidarity,\u201d and how do they motivate social change? Must solidarity be grounded in a shared social identity, e.g. race or gender? Do we have moral duties to stand in solidarity with others? What principles should govern solidary groups? Readings will include contemporary book-length treatments of these questions.", "title": "Solidarity and Social Change", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0.5, 9], "prerequisite": "YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 and YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 and at least one 3000 level Philosophy module or two 2000 level Philosophy modules or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU4256", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1930", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-PgRm2", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1930", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-PgRm2", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["YCC1113", "YCC1114"]}}
