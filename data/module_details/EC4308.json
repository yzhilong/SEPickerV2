{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The course will introduce the students to machine learning and data mining methods for economics problems. It will provide a conceptual understanding of the popular machine learning supervised methods including decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines as well as some unsupervised learning methods. Students will be able to learn how these methods differ from and complement the econometric models and to choose the right one for a given task. To apply the theory, the student will work on hands-on in-class examples, assignments, and the final project.", "title": "Machine Learning and Economic Forecasting", "department": "Economics", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2, 7.5], "prerequisite": "Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in EC, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\nEC3304", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "EC4308", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
