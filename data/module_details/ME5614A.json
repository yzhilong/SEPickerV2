{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module introduces applications and practices for additive manufacturing in terms of special project. The project is intended to integrate pre-processing, additive manufacturing processes, and post-processing for additive manufacturing processes. Topics include additive manufacturing practices and applications in engineering, design, healthcare, etc. Students are expected to carry out hand-on studies of additive manufacturing machines in project on the related topics. A structured programme of lectures and projects is included in this module.", "title": "Special Project in Additive Manufacturing", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 0, 0.5, 0, 2.5], "prerequisite": "Knowledge in principle of additive manufacturing; preprocessing\nand post-processing for additive manufacturing", "moduleCredit": "2", "moduleCode": "ME5614A", "attributes": {"lab": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E1-06-16", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
