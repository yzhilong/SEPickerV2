{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module focuses on the relationship between space and power. It investigates how political processes shape human geography, and conversely, how assumptions about geography underscore global politics. We will examine key themes, concepts, & theories that define the study of critical politics from a geographical perspective. Students will gain a critical understanding of and\nappreciation for the historical and contemporary challenges of sovereignty, territoriality, governmentality, identity, citizenship, difference, violence, genocide, colonialism, and war. The module culminates with the themes of resistance, emancipation, direct action, and anarchism, which will allow students to consider alternative configurations of space and power.", "title": "Political Geographies: Space and Power", "department": "Geography", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GE, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\n(Global Studies students) Must have read and passed GE1101E and GE2222.
