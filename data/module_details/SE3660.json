These are: the ability to conduct fieldwork; utilising a Southeast Asian language for academic study; and first-hand engagement with research methodological issues. \n\nThe student is expected to develop more reflexive research capacity and present a seminar at the end of the course.", "title": "Independent Study", "department": "Southeast Asian Studies", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 2, 4, 2, 2], "prerequisite": "Students should:  have completed a minimum of 24 MC in Southeast Asian Studies; and  have declared Southeast Asian Studies as their Major.  read or waived from: LAB 1201 & LAB 2201; LAT 1201 & LAT2201; or LAV1201 and LAV2201", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SE3660", "attributes": {"ism": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}]}
