{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course continues to develop a level of competence in design skills and critical thinking through a design task that increases the scale and complexity of considerations. Focusing on a high-dense urban context, students will be asked to retrofit existing neighbourhood landscapes in residential blocks/towns. The emphasis will be liveability and sustainability and will involve the integration of required spaces/facilities and innovative landscape elements within a high-dense urban context. They will work across a range of representational modes including technical diagrams and three dimensional physical/digital modelling to develop relative certainty in the functional and aesthetic aspects of their design proposal.", "title": "Design 5", "department": "Architecture", "faculty": "Design and Environment", "workload": [1, 2, 0, 5, 12], "prerequisite": "Min C grade for LAD2001 Design 3 and LAD2002 Design 4", "moduleCredit": "8", "moduleCode": "LAD3001", "semesterData": [], "fulfillRequirements": ["LAD3005"]}
