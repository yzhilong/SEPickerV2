Treating the\nsilk routes as networks of exchange as well as sites of\ninteractions where local dynamics meet global\nprocesses, this module not only canvasses the\nintellectual, social, artistic, and cultural histories of\nAsia, but also examines the theories and\nmethodologies of writing connected and/or\ncomparative Asian histories.", "title": "Silk Routes in Asia: Where the Global Meets the Local", "department": "Southeast Asian Studies", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CAS5881", "semesterData": []}
