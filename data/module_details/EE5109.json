One part of it is used as a PGMC for a Graduate Certificate on Robotics and Automation. The module covers practical approaches to modelling and identification of dynamical systems, and the applications of mechatronics, including the constituent technology components of sensors, actuators and control. Case studies of mechatronic applications will be done. Hands-on sessions will be conducted and a group design project will be done.", "title": "Modelling and Applications of Mechatronic Systems", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0.5, 1.5, 5], "prerequisite": "[applicable to UG level students only] EE3331C", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE5109", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "EE3331C"}
