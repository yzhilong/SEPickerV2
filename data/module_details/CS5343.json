{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "From the covert digital water in Titanic to the mixed real and virtual actors in Avatar, from the arm-controllable Wii games to the completely full-body-play Xbox Kinect games, computer animation technologies have advanced significantly during the past decades, both in the movie and the game industries. This module reveals all the exciting behind-the-scene techniques that make these movies and games possible, including but not limited to motion capture, fluid animation, facial animation, and fullbody character animation. This is a project-based course that aims to provide strong foundation on advanced computer animation methods and prepare students for research in animation.", "title": "Advanced Computer Animation", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 0, 1, 5.5, 1.5], "prerequisite": "(CS2010 or CS2020 or ((CS2030 or its equivalent) or CS2113/T) and (CS2040 or its equivalent)) and (MA1101R or MA1506) and (MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1505C or MA1521) and CS3241", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS5343", "attributes": {"lab": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"and": [{"and": [{"or": ["CS2010", "CS2020", {"or": ["CS2030", "CS2113", "CS2113T"]}]}, "CS2040"]}, {"or": ["MA1101R", "MA1506"]}, {"or": ["MA1102R", "MA1505", "MA1505C", "MA1521"]}, "CS3241"]}}
