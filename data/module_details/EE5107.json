Mathematical background materials, such as matrix properties and operations, dynamic system models and solutions and random variables will first be discussed, followed by major topics including notions of optimality, selection of cost functions, optimal state estimation, basic optimal control and model predictive control. Issues on the design and implementation of actual control systems will be addressed through a design project.", "title": "Optimal Control Systems", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "prerequisite": "[applicable to UG level students only] EE3331C or EE5101; or\n\n[applicable to GD level students only] EE5101 / EE5101R / ME5401.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE5107", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["EE3331C", "EE5101", "EE5101R", "ME5401"]}}
