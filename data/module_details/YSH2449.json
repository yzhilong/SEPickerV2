{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "In this course, we will study selections from the Hebrew Bible in its larger historical context and in light of related texts from the broader ancient Near East, primarily Babylonia and Assyria. Discussion will center on how the stories, law collections, and prophetic visions found in the Bible drew on texts and traditions from elsewhere, but reshaped them in fundamental ways, creating new and often revolutionary ideas about God, man, and the universe.", "title": "The Bible in Its Ancient Near Eastern Setting", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 12, 0, 0, 24], "moduleCredit": "1", "moduleCode": "YSH2449", "semesterData": []}
