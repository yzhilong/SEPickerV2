{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course describes a variety of Metaheuristic search methods including simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms, dynamically dimensioned search, particle swarm, differential evolution and multi-objective methods. The course also describes the use of sophisticated surrogate optimization algorithms for\ncomputationally expensive functions (including objective functions that are computed from a complex computer code.) The algorithms can be used to find values of discrete and/or continuous variables that optimize system performance, improve model forecast ability, and improve system reliability. All methods search for the global optimium and are derivative-free.", "title": "Adv Topics in SE: Metaheuristic & Surrogate Optimization", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 1, 6], "prerequisite": "Civil & Environmental Engineering / Industrial & Systems Engineering PhD-student standing (and students with no statistics background will need to do some extra reading)", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "IE6499A", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
