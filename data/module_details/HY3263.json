{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module will study political ideologies that served to legitimize colonial control in South Asia as well as the struggles against them. Through a series of case studies that focus on a range of issues, students will gain a better understanding of how imperialist discourses categorized and hierarchized communities on the basis of conceptions of religion, masculinity, supposed propensity to violence and hyper-sexuality. Students will also engage with revolutionary ideologies developed by anti-colonial figures and their differing approaches towards shaping national regeneration. The module will highlight and discuss the legacy of these contestations and debates in contemporary South Asia.", "title": "Imperialism and Anti-Colonialism in South Asia", "department": "History", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "HY3263", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
