Research is being carried out\nworldwide to find alternate sources of energy. Solar and\nwind energy sound most promising but their intermittent\nnature is a major drawback. To counter this, significant\nR&D is being done to devise efficient energy storage\ndevices. This module attempts to give an overview of\nalternate energy systems and highlight the importance of\nenergy storage devices. Principle of operation, R&D and\nfuture trends, merits and limitations of various energy\nstorage systems will be discussed. Pumped storage\ndevices, fuel cells, batteries and their types, super\ncapacitors and hydrogen storage will be focused upon.", "title": "Energy Storage Devices - State of the Art", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 4, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "FMS1206P", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 15, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
