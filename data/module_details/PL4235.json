The module will cover the history of moral psychology, and the shift from cognitive\u2010developmentalist theories of reasoning\u2010based morality to the current social intuitionist theory of intuition and emotion based morality. The course debates whether morality is innate, intuitive, emotion\u2010driven, reasoned, learned, or a dual process. In doing so, we will explore infants\u2019 and children\u2019s moral development, moral emotions, morality through neuroscience, morality across culture and in politics, and moral dilemmas from philosophical thought experiments.", "title": "The Psychology of Moral Judgments", "department": "Psychology", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3.5, 6], "prerequisite": "Completed 80 MCs of which student must have passed PL1101E, PL2131, PL2132 and 4 out of the 5 core modules (PL3232 - PL3236), which should include PL3234 and PL3235, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "PL4235", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1500", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
