Nonetheless, the cumulation of rights has become a standard protection strategy in sectors ranging from software to fashion and entertainment. Against this background, this module offers a detailed analysis of protection overlaps. Which combinations of rights are deemed permissible? Which specific problems arise from the cumulation of intellectual property rights? Using international, US and EU legislation and case law as reference points, these questions will be discussed. Moreover, the module will explore alternative avenues for better law and policy making.", "title": "Protection Overlaps in Intellectual Property Law", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent; and successful completion of either Law of Intellectual Property [LL4405A/LL5405A/LC5405A/LL6405A;\n[LL4405B/LL5405B/LC5405B/LL6405B] or Foundations of Intellectual Property [LL4070/LL5070/LC5070/LL6070; LL4070V/LL5070V/LC5070V/LL6070V] (or their\nequivalent).", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LL6394", "aliases": ["LL5394", "LL4394"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3], "venue": "E-Learn_D", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 10, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1430", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [1, 2, 3], "venue": "E-Learn_D", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 10, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3], "venue": "E-Learn_D", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 10, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
