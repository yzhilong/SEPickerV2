{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Narai (r. 1656-1688) was a Buddhist king in a largely Buddhist kingdom. Yet, he was praised as open-minded: his chief advisors were Muslims and Christians, and he eagerly adopted European technologies and Islamicate dress. On his deathbed, however, he found himself besieged on all sides by foreign soldiers, ambitious officials, Catholic priests, and Buddhist mobs. Why was Narai so interested in foreigners? How did religion get tied up with politics? Can we distinguish a palace coup from a popular revolution? In this course, we consider the \u201cearly modern\u201d roots of enduring conflicts over religion, race, revolution, and empire in Asia.", "title": "Narai: Siam\u2019s Worldly King and the Revolution of 1688", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
