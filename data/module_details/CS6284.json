The opportunities and challenges from emerging big-data processing systems have been raised different scales, from a single machine to thousands of machines. The need for effectively utilizing computing resources creates new technologies and research directions: from conventional ones (e.g., cluster computing, in-memory computing), to more recent ones (e.g., GPGPU, many-core processors, NVRAM).  This module will introduce students to the architecture, performance optimization and design of big data systems on various emerging high performance computing hardware including many-core processors and accelerators.", "title": "Topics in Computer Science: Big Data Meets New Hardware", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 0, 0, 4, 4], "prerequisite": "CS2100 Computer Organization and CS2102 Database Systems", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS6284", "attributes": {"lab": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CS2100", "CS2102"]}}
