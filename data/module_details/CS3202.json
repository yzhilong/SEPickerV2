These two modules together provide the students with hands-on experience in working in project groups through a complete SDLC to develop a well-tested, large-scaled software system. This second part focuses on applying best software engineering practices on the implementation and testing of the software system. The students will practice efficient implementation of software components, system integration, software version control, and rigorous testing.", "title": "Software Engineering Project II", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [1, 1, 0, 5, 3], "prerequisite": "CS2103 Software Engineering or its equivalent.", "corequisite": "CS3201 Software Engineering Project I", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS3202", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "CS2103"}
