{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "MCH5201, ME5401, EE5101R", "description": "linear system theory is the core of modern control appropaches, such as optimal, robust, adaptive and multi-variable control. This module develops a solid understanding of the fundamentals of linear systems analysis and design using the state space approach. Topics covered include state space representation of systems; solution of state equations; stability analysis using Lyapunov methods; controllability and observability; linear state feedback design; asymptotic observer and compensator design, decoupling and servo control. This module is a must for higher degree students in control engineering, robotics or servo engineering. It is also very useful for those who are interested in signal processing and computer engineering.", "title": "Linear Systems", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "[Applicable to UG level students only] ME2142 or EE3331C; or\n\n[Advisory applicable to GD level students only] Requires background knowledge such as EE4302 or ME4246.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE5101", "attributes": {"grsu": true, "mpes1": true}, "aliases": ["ME5401"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 100, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-12-03T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 150}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["ME2142", "EE3331C", "EE4302", "ME4246"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["EE5102", "EE5104", "EE5107", "EE5201", "EE6102", "EE6104", "EE6105", "EE6701", "EE6107", "EE6201"]}
