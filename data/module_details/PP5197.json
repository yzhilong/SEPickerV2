{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The abiding opportunity of our globalized, multicultural world is to take advantage of cultural diversity. As individuals, we have to learn to live and work in multicultural settings. Our institutions need to learn how to deal with cultural diversity. As we learn and innovate, we have to understand how to take what seems to work in one culture and think about how to apply it in our own cultural setting. Finally, we need to understand cultural change, including how to shape or resist it. The course draws from many disciplines and uses examples from Asia and around the world.", "title": "Cultural Competence", "department": "LKYSPP Dean's Office", "faculty": "LKY School of Public Policy", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 2, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PP5197", "semesterData": []}
