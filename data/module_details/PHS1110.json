Functional groups and ring structures are the key features that confer physicochemical and reactivity properties to chemical and biological drug molecules. Physicochemical properties that contribute to variation in drug likeness will be dealt with in detail. Functional groups and rings that are susceptible to structural derivatisation will be discussed in terms of the reaction mechanism involved illustrating how structural modifications can create better drug likeness.", "title": "Foundation for Medicinal and Synthetic Chemistry", "department": "Pharmacy", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 3, 0, 1, 4], "prerequisite": "H2 Chemistry or equivalent", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PHS1110", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [8, 9, 10, 11], "venue": "S4-02LAB", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Hybrid_B", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1030", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [8, 9, 10, 11], "venue": "S4-02LAB", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown", "A"], "examDate": "2020-11-23T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 90}], "fulfillRequirements": ["PR2288", "PR2289", "PR3204", "PHS1120", "PHS4220"]}
