{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Science communication and outreach programs employ a range of methods to engage audiences, deliver impact and communicate science. From capacity building programs in the developing world to science puppet shows for early learners, science communicators employ different methods, often to better engage with underserviced audiences, create impact and social change, and explore topics in more intriguing ways. As part of this, they need to be skilled at conceiving ideas, logistics and program planning, \u2018selling\u2019 their ideas and securing funding, running events and evaluating their success. In this course, you\u2019ll come up with a novel program idea, trial it, report on your trial and then learn how to win funding for it through grant applications and a presented \u2018pitch\u2019. This course is about creating your own original science communication project. It represents an authentic opportunity to develop real-world skills that allow your ideas to become realities. As you\u2019ll discover in your future science communication careers, if you want to pursue your passions, your goals and your ideas, skills to develop them and just as importantly get them funded are critical. Many past students\u2019 ideas have turned into actual, fully funded, real-world ongoing projects that have had national and global impacts, so don\u2019t underestimate what you might achieve if you make the most of it! If you choose, this can be so much more than just another assignment.", "title": "Science Communication Project Design and Delivery", "department": "FoS Dean's Office", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [4.5, 0, 0, 0, 8], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "MW5253", "semesterData": []}
