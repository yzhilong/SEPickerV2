It continues the introduction that begins in CS1010, and emphasises objectoriented programming with application to simple data structures. Topics include object-oriented problem modeling with objects, classes and methods, object-oriented problem formulation and solving, data structure implementation strageties, abstraction and encapsulation of data structures, object-oriented programming constructs, APIs and class libraries, exception handling, lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables and their algorithmic design, sorting and searching methods, recursive algorithms, and Big-O notation. This module is appropriate for FoE students.", "title": "Data Structures and Algorithms I", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 1, 1, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "CS1010E or its equivalent", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS1020E", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "CS1010E", "fulfillRequirements": ["CS2010"]}
