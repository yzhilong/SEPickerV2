{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EE5306, EE5137R", "description": "This is a course on stochastic processes. The emphasis of this course is on mathematical rigor of principles and concepts in stochastic processes with an eye towards modeling of real-world systems. Students are expected to do simple proofs in addition to rudimentary calculations. Topics include measure-theoretic probability, Poisson processes, renewal processes, Markov chains and decision theory.", "title": "Stochastic Processes", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "[applicable to UG level students only] EE2012 or EE2012A or ST2334; or\n\n[Advisory applicable to GD level students only] Requires knowledge of probability and statistics at the level of NUS-ECE undergraduate module EE2012 or equivalent", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE5137", "attributes": {"grsu": true, "mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT1", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 70, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-04-30T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 150}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["EE2012", "EE2012A", "ST2334"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["EE6136", "EE6735"]}
