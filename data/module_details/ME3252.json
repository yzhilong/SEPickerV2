Commonly used materials in different engineering designs and emerging materials and processes, and life cycle assessment will be taught. Concepts on surface engineering, strengthening and hardening techniques, hardenability, heat treatment, friction and wear properties will be provided. Key material properties and testing such as tensile testing, compression testing, torsion test, 3-point bending test will be introduced along with their specific relevance. Finally, students will be introduced to the different ways of degradation of materials when it reacts with environment.", "title": "Materials for Mechanical Engineering", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 3, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME3252", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
