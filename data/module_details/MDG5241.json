{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module will present modern statistical methods for analyzing large-scale -omics data, with emphasis on application to real-world data. A variety of statistical methods and computing approaches will be covered, including hypothesis testing for high-dimensional data, dimension reduction techniques, and machine learning methods commonly employed in -omics data analysis such as tree-based methods and support vector machine. The module will also include in-class computing exercise for model estimation and inference, such as the expectation-maximization algorithm and sampling-based Bayesian inference. The module will end with advanced statistical approaches for the integration of two or more -omics data.", "title": "Advanced Statistical Methods for Bioinformatics", "department": "NUS Medicine Dean's Office", "faculty": "Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine", "workload": [2, 2, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "College-level statistics or statistics modules designed for life science majors; background in biology/chemistry preferred, but not required; some familiarity with R", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MDG5241", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}]}
