{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The course looks at health and human development in the context of a global economy. We will study the large improvements in health that have occurred in the last two centuries due to rising incomes and technological advances in public health and heath care. These health improvements will be linked to human capital and increased worker productivity as well as longer life spans and savings for retirement. The effects of health on population growth and development will also be investigated. We will look at the welfare implications of health improvements, economic growth, and globalization.", "title": "Globalization, Health, and Human Development", "department": "LKYSPP Dean's Office", "faculty": "LKY School of Public Policy", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 4, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PP5166", "semesterData": []}
