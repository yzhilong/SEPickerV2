{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course continues to develop a level of competence in design skills and critical thinking by applying landscape architectural design techniques and knowledge students have gained in previous studios. Students will be asked to retrofit existing infrastructure on a planning scale that increases the scale and complexity of considerations. The emphasis will be to develop a multifunctional landscape infrastructure that serves ecosystem functions. This will involve the integration of required engineering parameters and innovative landscape interventions towards resilient and sustainable cities. Students will use a range of representational modes to develop relative certainty in multi-functional aspects of their design proposal.", "title": "Design 6", "department": "Architecture", "faculty": "Design and Environment", "workload": [1, 2, 0, 5, 12], "prerequisite": "Min C grade for LAD2001 Design 3 and LAD2002 Design 4\nLAD3001 as pre-requisite", "moduleCredit": "8", "moduleCode": "LAD3002", "semesterData": [], "fulfillRequirements": ["LAD3005"]}
