Topics are varied, but include global warming, the ozone hole, air pollution, the Gaia hypothesis, eco-philosophy and environmental politics. No students are excluded. Only an elementary knowledge of science is assumed.", "title": "Our Atmosphere: A Chemical Perspective", "department": "Chemistry", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "Available to all students", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GEK1535", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
