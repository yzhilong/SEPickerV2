{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The objective of this course is for you to be able to integrate two disciplines, Evolutionary Biology and Developmental Biology into a common framework. We will explore the evolution of animal bodies, e.g. legs, segments, eyes, wings, etc., by focusing on changes at the molecular and developmental levels. This course will introduce you to important concepts such as hox genes, selector genes, homology, serial homology, modularity, gene regulatory networks, genetic architecture, developmental basis of sexual dimorphism, and phenotypic plasticity, and give you a broad organismic-centred perspective on the evolution of novel traits.", "title": "Evolution of Development", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 2, 4], "prerequisite": "The course requires some basic training in Evolutionary Biology and Developmental Biology in order to enable students to integrate these disciplines throughout the course.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BL5227B", "semesterData": []}
