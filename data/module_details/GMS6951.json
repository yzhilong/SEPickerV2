{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Healthcare is a complex system of interacting entities.  Achieving  effective and sustainable behavior requires more than a reactive approach. System dynamics is a robust way to evaluate potential solutions to complex system problems. This module is relevant to individuals with a wide range of backgrounds including biology, business, engineering, public policy. Students develop expertise in identifying system structures such as accumulations, feedbacks, and time delays that generate and perpetuate particular system behaviors. The module covers qualitative methods for representing complex causal relationships as well as simulation model construction to gain quantitative insights into system behaviors and suggest effective, sustainable solutions.", "title": "Dynamic Modelling of Healthcare Services and Systems", "department": "Duke-NUS Dean's Office", "faculty": "Duke-NUS Medical School", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 4, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GMS6951", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "DUKE05-11A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
