{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Constitutional government in the modern era has developed different organisational and functional models, that draw their inspiration from some main principles (eg. Separation of powers, checks and balances, limited government, democratic accountability) that are distinguishing features of the same type of state. The module will consequently highlight the different forms of (presidential, semi-presidential, parliamentary) government, as experienced by the states belonging to both the common law and the civil law legal traditions. Reference will be made also to forms of constitutional government based on territorial division of powers, such as federal systems and supranational organisations such as the Europe Union.", "title": "Comparative Constitutional Government", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LL4256", "semesterData": []}
