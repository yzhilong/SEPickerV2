{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module focuses on J.S. Bach\u2019s solo instrumental works, with an emphasis on the dance suite. Selected works include the unaccompanied Sonata and Partitas for Violin, Cello Suites, and the Keyboard Suites. The contextual use of dance rhythms and forms in other Bach works, and neo-baroque trends in the 20th century will also be topics of discussion.\n\nThe module aims to bridge compositional thinking with performance and interpretative analysis. Thus, analysis, composition, and performance are represented as modes of learning. Major assessment is in the form of analytical\nwork and music compositions that are performed in class and/or public concerts.", "title": "Bach Suites", "department": "YSTCM Dean's Office", "faculty": "YST Conservatory of Music", "workload": [0, 3, 2, 3, 2], "prerequisite": "MUT1101: Introduction to MCM", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MUT3216", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": []}
