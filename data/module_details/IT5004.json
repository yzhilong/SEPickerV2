{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "IS2102", "description": "This module aims to equip non-computing students with fundamental knowledge in architecting and designing modern Enterprise Systems in organisations that can be reasonably complex, scalable, distributed, component-based and missioncritical. Students will develop an understanding of high-level concepts such as enterprise architecture and software architecture. They will them move on to acquire fundamental systems analysis and design techniques such as object-oriented requirements analysis and design using the Unified Modelling Language.", "title": "Enterprise Systems Architecture Fundamentals", "department": "Information Systems and Analytics", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], "corequisite": "IT5001", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "IT5004", "attributes": {"lab": true, "mpes2": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": {"start": "2021-01-14", "end": "2021-04-15"}, "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 120, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": {"start": "2021-01-14", "end": "2021-04-15"}, "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 120, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
