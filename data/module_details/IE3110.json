{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "DSC3221", "description": "This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modeling techniques, random number generators, discrete-event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyze and develop simulation models of given problems.", "title": "Simulation", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 1, 0.5, 4, 4], "prerequisite": "IE2100 or DSC3215", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "IE3110", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["IE2100", "DSC3215"]}}
