{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This   module   introduces   numerical   methods   and   statistics. Students will learn the fundamentals of numerical methods and statistics and how to apply these to solve a range of engineering and science problems. \n\nThey  will  mainly  write  and  debug their  own  codes  in  MATLAB\u00ae and  are  exposed  to  complex  engineering  problems  and  solving through    COMSOL\u00ae    Multiphysics \u2013 a    finite-element-based simulation environment. \n\nThe   numerical   methods   include,   e.g.,   solving   for   roots   of equations,   integrating   numerically   and   finding   solutions   to ordinary   and   partial   differential   equations.   The   statistical methods include basic concepts of probability and statistics and how they are used in the acquisition and processing of data.", "title": "Numerical Methods and Statistics", "department": "Engineering Science Programme", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "(MA1507 and MA1508/MA1508E) or equivalent", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ESP2107", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E4-04-03", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E5-03-19", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E5-03-19", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1100", "weeks": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "venue": "E5-03-19", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E5-03-19", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2020-12-02T05:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["MA1507", {"or": ["MA1508", "MA1508E"]}]}}
