{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Model-based analytical techniques have been used effectively to understand processes, constraints, relationships and issues in complex management and system engineering problems. An organization can exploit these techniques to\nmake better decisions under uncertainties, derive cost-savings in operations, design better products and create new services. Participants in the course will learn to identify opportunities for improvement within their organizations, develop\nskills in using and managing model-based analysis effectively, and become more\ndisciplined thinkers in systems engineering and management issues. Examples and case studies will be drawn from a variety of practical scenarios such as network design, engineering design optimization, logistics and supply chains, and\noperations management.", "title": "Management Science in Systems Engineering", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [25, 42, 14, 14, 35], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SYE5005", "semesterData": []}
