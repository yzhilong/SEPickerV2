{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module is the second of two introductory modules focusing on unsupervised machine learning algorithms and techniques. Students will be taught to analyse datasets, perform necessary transformations, build machine learning models to derive insights, and evaluate and subsequently make adjustments to fine-tune models appropriately. Topics include clustering, dimensionality reduction, generative models, feature selection and generation, recommender systems, and neural networks and deep learning algorithms, with discussion on application into various engineering use cases.", "title": "Statistical Learning in Engineering II", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "IE5603", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
