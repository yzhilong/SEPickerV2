{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course uses The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, first published in 1789, to investigate both the invention of a new genre\u2014the Atlantic slave narrative\u2014and the historical context that shaped Equiano\u2019s life. Written by a former slave and key antislavery activist, this multi-layered text personalizes major historical events, including the slave trade in West Africa, the transportation of 12 million Africans to America, and the anti-slavery movement. Combining aspects of the captivity narrative, travel writing, and spiritual autobiography, The Interesting Narrative will be treated as both a historical source and a literary work.", "title": "Equiano's Slave Narrative: Texts & Contexts", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2.5, 7], "prerequisite": "Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
