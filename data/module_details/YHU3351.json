{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This Historical Immersion course examines the figure of Kong Zi (Confucius) as both an actual historical figure of his times and as a quasi-fictional character in whose name a body of literature arose in the three or four centuries after his lifetime. It includes an examination of the historical circumstances of the Chunqiu period in which he lived and the influence he had both directly on his times and upon philosophical debates yet to emerge. Primary sources will include both historiographical references and philosophical texts purported to record him in conversation with disciples, heads of states, and other figures.", "title": "Kong Zi: The Man, the Myth, the Legend", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
