{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Politics in a modern state is the art of living together within a framework of enforceable laws, and at its centre is deliberation about what those laws should\nbe. Michael Oakeshott provides a coherent theory of politics in these terms while locating politics within a wider range of concerns including science, history, ethics, religion, rhetoric, education, human nature, and the foundations and limits of knowledge.
