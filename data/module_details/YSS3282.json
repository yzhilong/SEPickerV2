The course will look at the relationship between architecture and specific social institutions (the family, secular welfare, the nation, the state), as well as attending to the role of architecture in a range of social processes, including the exercise of power, identity formation, care, production and reproduction, and consumption. It will also address the emergence of a professionalised field of architecture and the establishment of building standards.", "title": "Architecture and Society", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2.5, 7], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS3282", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1030", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "ERC-ALR", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1030", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "ERC-ALR", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
