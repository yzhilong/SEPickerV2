{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course explores virology, which is the study of viruses\nthat infect different forms of living organisms. It introduces\ngeneral concepts related to the viral structure, host\nspectrum and replication. We will elaborate how viruses\nare identified, how viruses go \u201cviral\u201d and how we can live\nwith viruses. The impacts of viral diseases on human\nhealth, food security and environment will be discussed.\nThe course also includes new developments in how\nviruses can be used as vectors for drug delivery,\nnanomaterials and bio-control agents. Students will have\nchances to practice virus culture, isolation and infectivity\nassay.", "title": "General Virology", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 0, 2, 1, 5], "prerequisite": "LSM1102 Molecular Genetics AND\nLSM1106 Molecular Cell Biology AND LSM2191\nLaboratory Techniques in Life Sciences", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LSM3227", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "S1A-04LAB3", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["A", "Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-30T05:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["LSM1102", "LSM1106", "LSM2191"]}}
