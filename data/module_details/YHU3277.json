In this course, we will explore how the European quest for foreign items, exotic tastes, and intoxicating substances drove exploration, trade, and colonialism during the early modern era. This insatiable pursuit led to the discovery of the Americas, the growth of the Atlantic slave trade, and the development of a globalized marketplace that connected the \u201cEast\u201d with the \u201cWest.\u201d In this course, we will study key historical transformations that created the world we live in today: the \u201cmarketplace revolution,\u201d the \u201cbirth\u201d of consumer culture and the middle class, the origins of capitalism, and the emergence of modernity itself. We will do so through the prism of the consumable goods and material artefacts that drove these changes. We will explore how these substances were produced, trafficked, consumed, politicised, and aestheticized in the context of broader social processes.", "title": "Objects of Desire: Consumers, Colonialism, and Global Trade", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0.5, 2.5, 0, 2.5, 7], "prerequisite": "All Year 1 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU3277", "semesterData": []}
