The module begins with a birds-eye view of organ systems and their integration, organized around a limited number of simplifying themes.  Deeper explorations will be made into a small number of human adaptations, exploring selection, maladaptation to modern living, and human variation.  The module is intended to be accessible to students for whom this is their first college-level science course and to be of value to anyone interested in human biology, regardless of major.", "title": "Human Biology", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [1, 3, 0, 0, 8.5], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC2234", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-CR15", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-CR15", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2020-11-26T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 180}]}
