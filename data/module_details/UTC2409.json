They will apply the knowledge they acquire in the classroom to real-world situations through group projects and collaborations with a community partner.", "title": "Understanding Communities: Theory & Practice", "department": "College of Alice and Peter Tan", "faculty": "Residential College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UTC2409", "attributes": {"su": true}, "aliases": ["UTS2407"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "CAPT-SR1-2", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 9, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "CAPT-SR1-2", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 9, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
