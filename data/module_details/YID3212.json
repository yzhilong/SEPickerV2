{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The world is a risky place. Every year, natural hazards affect millions of people, with increasingly expensive losses. This course explores risk associated with geophysical phenomena. Are there more hazardous events now than in the past? Are these events somehow more energetic? Or are increasing populations with increasingly disparate incomes being exposed to hazards? What physical, economic, political and social tools can be employed to reduce this risk? We draw on examples from recent disasters, both rapid onset (earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones), and slow onset (climate change, famine) to examine complex and interlinked vulnerabilities in the coupled human-environment system.", "title": "Risk and Geohazard", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6], "prerequisite": "YID1201 Introduction to Environmental Studies or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YID3212", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "YID1201"}
