{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module consists of two parts related to coastal processes and sediment transport.\n\nThe first part covers some basics of nearshore hydrodynamics, including wave shoaling, wave refraction and surf zone processes (wave breaking, wave-induced setup and longshore current). The student will also be introduced to the concepts of coastal boundary layer flows, which determines the driving forces for coastal sediment transport, e.g. bottom friction.\n\nThe second part of the module will introduce coastal sediment transport. The students will begin with learning the basic concepts of sediment transport. Some fundamental knowledge of typical coastal engineering practices will be introduced, e.g., equilibrium beach profile, longshore sediment transport and scour for coastal structures.\n\nBesides the theories, the students will also learn the state-of-the-art numerical modelling techniques for prediction of shoreline erosions. Some introductions on beach erosion due to sea level rise will be covered.", "title": "Coastal Processes & Sediment Transport", "department": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 4, 3], "prerequisite": "CE5307A", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CE5308", "attributes": {"grsu": true, "lab": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E1-06-02", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-04-27T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 150}], "prereqTree": "CE5307A"}
