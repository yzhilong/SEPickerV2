{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "NM3234 Leadership, Organisations and New Media", "description": "This module examines different forms of leadership models and maps them against new emerging approaches brought on by global change, such as cultures of digitisation, new communication platforms and social issues, for example, in gender and environmental contexts. Leadership in the public, private and community (and not-for-profit) sectors also face challenges of leadership stability and on-going calls for better management of transitional strategies. This module takes a hands-on approach to these leadership issues in response to this social, political and digital milieu, leading students on an experiential journey as leaders, thinkers and change-makers.", "title": "Leadership, Organisations and Communication", "department": "Communications and New Media", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [1, 3, 0, 3, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "NM3234Y", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "W1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "W1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}, {"semester": 4, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}]}
