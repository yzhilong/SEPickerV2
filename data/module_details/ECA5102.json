{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EC5152, EC5102A", "description": "This subject covers topics in modern Macroeconomic Theory and Policy at the advanced level. The emphasis will be laid on recent advances in the theories about long-term growth and short-term business cycle, and in the related empirical and policy debates. The growth theory includes neoclassical growth models (particularly the Ramsey and overlapping-generations models), and various endogenous growth models with knowledge spillovers, human capital and R&D investment. We also consider income distribution, convergence, income ranking, and population ageing in the growth models. The business cycle theory includes the real-business cycle model and various New Keynesian models. The policy issues include national debt, social security, and monetary policies. It helps students understand the frontier debates in macroeconomics.", "title": "Macroeconomics", "department": "Economics", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 2, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ECA5102", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "3", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-25T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}]}
