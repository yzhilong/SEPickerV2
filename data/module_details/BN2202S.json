{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "BN2101S", "description": "This module will present fundamental transport solutions which model the major features of biological flow. The conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in a system will be studied and applied to blood flows in the cardiovascular system. Basic knowledge of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics will also be covered. Bifurcation flow and Hemorheology in macrocirculation and microcirculation will be discussed. Basic mass transfer will be introduced to the students.", "title": "Introduction to Biotransport", "department": "Biomedical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 0.5, 0, 3, 4.5], "prerequisite": "BIE Stage 2 standing and Engineering students doing Minor in Bioengineering", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BN2202S", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
