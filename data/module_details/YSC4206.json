{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Harmonic Analysis is a classical field of mathematics with roots in\nsolving partial differential equations and also playing a major role in\nquantum physics. \u201cBig Data\u201d has made applied harmonic analysis a\nmajor field of current mathematical research. Applications range from\nmedical to astronomical imaging, from X-ray crystallography to data compression or machine learning. This module is an introduction to\nbasic techniques of harmonic analysis (convolution, approximation,\nFourier analysis) and applications in physics or data science (frames\nwavelets, sparsity).
