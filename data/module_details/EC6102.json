{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course builds on EC5102 Macroeconomic Theory, and stresses the use of dynamic programming in the study of macroeconomic problems.  The emphasis will be placed on building and analyzing models and analyzing existence, optimality and dynamic properties of equilibria.  The theory of dynamic programming will be developed in some detail and be applied to macroeconomic issues such as economic growth (including multi-sector models and endogenous growth), economic fluctuations, recursive competitive equilibrium, search and matching models, design of optimal monetary and fiscal policies, neo-Keynesian models, and advanced topics in consumption, investment and asset pricing.", "title": "Advanced Macroeconomic Theory", "department": "Economics", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 2, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EC6102", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT11", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
