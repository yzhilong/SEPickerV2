Defined by language, culture, history, government, military power, and clear boundaries, a nation organizes how citizens run their lives and their businesses. More recently, the dominance of nations has been challenged \u2013 sometimes subtly, sometimes aggressively \u2013 by multinational companies, which can seem to exist above governments\u2019 sway.
