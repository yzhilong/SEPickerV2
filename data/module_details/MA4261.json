The focus of this module is the mathematical aspect of coding theory and cryptography. Upon completing this module, the student will have a basic appreciation of some key issues in coding theory and cryptography, some understanding of the basic theory concerning codes and ciphers and\na good knowledge of some well-known codes and ciphers. Major Topics: Communication channels and Shannon\u2019s theorem, block codes and linear codes, maximum-likelihood decoding and syndrome decoding, bounds on codes and optimal codes, cyclic codes, BCH codes, encoding and decoding of cyclic codes. Public-key cryptography, RSA cryptosystem, public-key cryptosystems based on the discrete logarithm problem, elliptic curve cryptosystems, factorization algorithm and pseudoprime.", "title": "Coding and Cryptography", "department": "Mathematics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "MA3201 or MA3218 or MA3265", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MA4261", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1900", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1900", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2021-05-05T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 150}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["MA3201", "MA3218", "MA3265"]}}
