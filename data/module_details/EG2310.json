{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EG1310 Exploratory Satellite Design", "description": "This module aims to introduce freshmen who are interested in the Innovation & Design Programme to the basic principles of systems design that involve mechanical, electrical, and software elements. The module will cover the fundamentals of mechanical design, electrical hardware design, as well as middleware software frameworks to create an autonomous mobile robot with add-on sensors for targeting and a mechanically actuated projectile payload. Students will learn the essentials of individual sub-systems through hands-on exercises and homework assignments, and subsequently integrate these subsystems in a final project utilizing open-source software platforms to perform a number of missions.", "title": "Fundamentals of Systems Design", "department": "FoE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 0, 3, 3, 2], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EG2310", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E2A-03-01", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 25, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E2A-02-01", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 25, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "3", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E2A-03-02", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 25, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "3", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E2A-03-02", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 25, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E2A-02-01", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 25, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E2A-03-01", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 25, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
