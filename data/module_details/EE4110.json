{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Solid-state microwave circuits are usually realised using planar technologies, which integrate some or all components on a substrate.  Moreover, monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) enable commercial application of microwave technology.  This module therefore teaches design methods for microwave integrated circuits. Topics covered:  review of design concepts. MIC Design: fabrication techniques, modeling of active and passive networks, microstrip and coplanar lines. MMIC Design: lump element design, foundry rules, modeling of active and passive networks, design techniques - Layout and DRC Checks.   Selected Hands-on design work on (a) Passive Network - MIC filter and coupler, and (b) Active Network - MMIC oscillator and mixer.", "title": "RFIC and MMIC Design", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [1, 0.5, 1.5, 4, 3], "prerequisite": "EE3104C", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE4110", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "EE3104C"}
