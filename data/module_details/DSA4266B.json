Only when algorithms and technology are applied to meaningful problems or hypotheses can useful information be extracted from data for making decisions. This module is conducted as a series of hackathons: data scientists from partnering organisations in the technology sector provide the real-world situations and data which will enable students to gain practical experience in (i) formulating problems, (ii) solving them by applying, or developing and implementing, appropriate data-analytic tools and techniques, and (iii) communicating findings and insights gained clearly.", "title": "Sense-making Case Analysis: Technology", "department": "Statistics and Applied Probability", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [0, 1.5, 0, 2, 1.5], "prerequisite": "CS3244 Machine Learning and DSA3101 Data Science in Practice, or by permission", "moduleCredit": "2", "moduleCode": "DSA4266B", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CS3244", "DSA3101"]}}
