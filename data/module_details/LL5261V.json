{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Taken concurrently with \u201cCrossing Borders\u201d but with an emphasis on experiential learning, this module offers students the opportunity to explore the legal issues affecting migrant workers, both in the classroom and through externships and case work. Students will spend most of their time outside of class, gaining practical experience by first interning at the Ministry of Manpower over the holidays and then, during the semester, volunteering an average of 10 hours weekly with either Justice Without Borders (JWB) or the NUS-HOME Theft Project (\u201cTheft Project\u201d). In class, using peer learning, including roundtable case review, students will hone their legal skills while examining the legal framework governing Singapore\u2019s foreign workers. Analysing their externship experiences, students will explore the relationship between law on the books and law in action.", "title": "Employment Law & Migrant Workers Clinic", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "workload": [0, 1, 8, 0, 1], "prerequisite": "(a) Only Singapore Citizens for externships at the Ministry of\nManpower beginning in July; (b) NUS Compulsory Core Law\nCurriculum, NUS Legal Skills Programme or equivalent; (c)\nCrossing Borders: Law, Migration & Citizenship\n[LL4134/LL5134/LL6134; LL4134V/LL5134V/LL6134V] (may be\ntaken concurrently).", "corequisite": "Crossing Borders: Law, Migration and Citizenship (LL4134; LL5134; LL6134 / LL4134V; LL5134; LL6134)", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "LL5261V", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"and": [{"or": ["LL4134", "LL5134", "LL6134"]}, {"or": ["LL4134V", "LL5134V", "LL6134V"]}]}}
