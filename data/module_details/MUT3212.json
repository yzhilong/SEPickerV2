{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Modal Counterpoint focuses on the music of Palestrina and his contemporaries, which is a largely linear style. In this course, students will study how melodic lines create harmony, as opposed to the concept of yielding melody from harmony.\n\nA progressive and musical approach is taken in this course. It begins with the introduction of elements of style and an aural immersion. The course gradually proceeds from two-voice counterpoint to three, and even four-voice counterpoint.\n\nDue to the vocal nature of this style, compositional work would be complemented with in-class choral singing, and supported by interpretative analysis.", "title": "Modal Counterpoint", "department": "YSTCM Dean's Office", "faculty": "YST Conservatory of Music", "workload": [1, 2, 2, 3, 2], "prerequisite": "MUT1101: Introduction to MCM;\n3 Core Compositional Engagement (Theory) Electives and/or permission of the instructor", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MUT3212", "semesterData": []}
