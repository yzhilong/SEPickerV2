{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module is an introduction to classical algebraic number theory. It covers topics chosen from: algebraic integers, unique factorization of ideals, class group, unit theorem, ramification, decomposition and inertia groups, geometry of numbers, zeta functions and L-functions. If time permits, further topics which may be covered include: p-adic numbers, adeles and ideles, prime number theorem and modular forms.", "title": "Number Theory", "department": "Mathematics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "MA4203 or MA5203 or departmental approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MA5202", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "S17-0512", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 28, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "S17-0512", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 28, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-05-07T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 150}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["MA4203", "MA5203"]}}
