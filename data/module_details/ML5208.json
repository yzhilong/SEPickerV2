{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Methods for analyzing stresses in elastically dissimilar films deposited on structures and their applications in modern industries, stress concentrations on a wavy film surface, the criteria for the formation of threading dislocations in heteroepitaxial thin films and in layered structures, surface shapes and growth modes, the morphological stability of a stressed flat films against roughening and its application in the self-assembly of nano-structures. Learning objectives: Apply basic knowledge of the mechanical properties of materials to thin film-substrate films. Target students: Graduate students of Materials Science and related disciplines.", "title": "Mechanical Properties of Solid Films", "department": "Materials Science", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 0.5, 0, 1.5, 6], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ML5208", "semesterData": []}
