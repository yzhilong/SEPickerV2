{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Increasingly, young people around the world are asking questions about the ethics and politics of having children in the age of climate change. This course will focus on relevant considerations to these questions, such as the sociology of reproduction; ethical considerations about what we owe future generations and what individuals owe their children; the carbon footprint of reproduction; concerns about \u201coverpopulation\u201d; the role of individual choices in responding to climate change; how these questions are different (and differently felt) for people based on factors, such as nationality and class; adoption; challenges to the heteronormative family structure; and visions of the future. We will analyse research from environmental studies, sociology, women\u2019s and gender studies, and philosophy, and also engage with relevant literature and film.", "title": "The Ethics and Politics of Reproduction in the Age of Climate Change", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 9.5, 0], "prerequisite": "YID1201 Introduction to Environmental Studies or YID2208 Foundations of Environmental Humanities or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YID3220", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1430", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 12, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1430", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 12, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["YID1201", "YID2208"]}}
