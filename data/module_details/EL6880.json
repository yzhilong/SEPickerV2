{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This advanced seminar provides graduate students with sustained and critical engagement with recent debates in  grammatical theory.  Students are expected to identify for themselves key issues in grammatical theory (e.g the architecture of a theory of grammar, the analysis of specific grammatical phenomena, the epiphenomenality of constructions), situate these issues in relation to wider debates about nature of grammar, and propose lines of inquiry that might contribute to the debates. The seminar is especially useful for students who are considering pursuing research in grammatical anaylsis/theory.", "title": "Topics in Grammatical Theory", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "Admission to the PhD programme or doctoral competence in the discipline to be determined by the Department upon recommendation by the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EL6880", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 1, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "AS1-0201", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 1, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
