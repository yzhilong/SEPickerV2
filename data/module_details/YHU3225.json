The long history of Pompeii closely maps onto the evolution\nof Rome from an Italian city\u2010state into a cosmopolitan world\u2010empire. In this\ncourse, we will discuss the use \u2010 and misuse \u2010 of literary, documentary,\nepigraphic, and archaeological evidence in the practice of pre\u2010modern history. We will cover the high and the low, from taverns, brothels and workshops to\nthe business of wealthy merchants, local politicians and members of the\nimperial family.", "title": "Pompeii: Art, Urban Life & Culture in the Roman Empire", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
