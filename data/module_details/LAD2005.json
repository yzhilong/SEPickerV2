{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module provides an understanding of the basic concepts and uses of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology and spatial analysis. GIS is a combination of software and hardware with capabilities for manipulating, analyzing and displaying spatially-referenced information-information which is referenced by its location on the earth's surface. By linking data to maps, GIS reveals relationships not apparent with traditional item-referenced information systems and database management products, and by displaying information in a graphic form, it unpacks complex spatial patterns. The course emphasizes the concepts needed to use GIS correctly and effectively for manipulating, querying, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data.", "title": "Introductory GIS for Landscape Architecture", "department": "Architecture", "faculty": "Design and Environment", "workload": [0, 2, 3, 5, 0], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LAD2005", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
