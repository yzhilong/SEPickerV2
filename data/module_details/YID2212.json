Understanding how to use and analyse it is the most critical skill of the 21st century. Particularly for the environment, which brings together a multitude of complex systems and phenomena, we need to be equipped to derive clear signals from oceans of noise and from vast amounts of data that are being generated on a daily basis to underpin sound policy choices and scientific inquiry. This course will introduce students to analyse quantitative environmental data using R and give an overview of foundational and cutting-edge data science techniques.", "title": "Data Science for the Environment", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2.5, 7], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YID2212", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-PgRm1", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-PgRm1", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
