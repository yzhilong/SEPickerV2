{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module introduces to students the system dynamics modelling method, based on the foundations of systems thinking. System dynamics is a powerful methodology to support the inquiry of complex large-scale dynamic sociotechnical systems through computer simulation models. Central topics include feedback mechanisms, nonlinear\nrelationship, time delay models, causal loop diagramming stock-flow models, decision behaviour modelling, testing and validation of models. Instruction is supplemented with\ncase studies from supply chains, population and environmental modelling. Group projects are used facilitate hands-on model building and learning in and outside the classroom.", "title": "System Dynamics Modelling", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 0, 1, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "IE2111", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "IE4250", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "IE2111"}
