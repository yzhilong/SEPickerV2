{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "What can theatre and performance do in the face of climate change, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss? This module explores how a range of playwrights, theatre-makers, and performance artists have responded to this question. Drawing on a wealth of recent eco-conscious scholarship within\ntheatre and performance studies, we consider topics such as eco-theatre, theatre and the anthropocene, theatre and the posthuman, theatre and animals, immersive and site-responsive performance, and ecoscenography. The module also considers how the application of environmental and eco-critical paradigms to theatre may enable a deeper understanding of what theatre is.", "title": "Theatre Ecologies", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "TS1101E or GEM1003 or GEH1058 or GEK1055", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "TS3236", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 40, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["TS1101E", "GEM1003", "GEH1058", "GEK1055"]}}
