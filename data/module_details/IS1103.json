The objective is to develop students to be ethical computing decision-makers who can analyse and explain their decisions in real-world policy-making situations. Issues in emerging areas such as Digital Intellectual Property Rights, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Social Media, Hacking, and interface design may also be discussed in relation to Ethics.", "title": "Ethics in Computing", "department": "Information Systems and Analytics", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 2, 0, 3, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "IS1103", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}], "fulfillRequirements": ["IS3101", "IS3221", "IS3240", "IS4100", "IS4240", "IS4241", "IS4250", "IS3251", "IS3103"]}
