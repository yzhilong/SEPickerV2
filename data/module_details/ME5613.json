{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module focuses on analysis, optimal design techniques and fabrication methods of multi-functional structures and devices. The underlying principles of\ncalculus of variations, constrained minimization, and design parameterization and solution methods of topology optimization will be fully studied. Key applications include compliant structures/mechanisms and multi-material soft robots. These devices lie at the interface of principles and procedures of structures and machines. The module will bring out methodologies for designing multi-functional structures/machines and fabrication techniques of 3D printing.", "title": "Optimal Design of Multi-Functional Structures", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 1, 6], "prerequisite": "Finite Element Methods or Structural Analysis or Solid Mechanics or an equivalent", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME5613", "semesterData": []}
