{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "GEH1058", "description": "While many of us spend much of our lives glued to small computer screens, theatrical productions continue to bring people together for shared experiences. What are the attractions of theatre, what makes it distinct, and how can it enrich our understanding of human society? This module, which requires no prior knowledge of theatre, starts with the spectator\u2019s experience and works outwards. We learn how to analyse theatre\u2019s styles and effects. We explore how human societies use theatre to confront questions and express beliefs, hopes, and anxieties. We examine how cultures influence each other through theatre, and how theatre provokes change.", "title": "The Theatre Experience", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 2, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GEK1055", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [], "fulfillRequirements": ["TS3236"]}
