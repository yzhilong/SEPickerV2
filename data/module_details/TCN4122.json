{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "CN4122E", "description": "This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical\nprocesses.", "title": "Process Synthesis and Simulation", "department": "SCALE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Cont and Lifelong Education", "workload": [2, 2, 0, 1.5, 2], "prerequisite": "TCN2116, TCN2121, TCN3124 & TCN3132", "moduleCredit": "3", "moduleCode": "TCN4122", "aliases": ["CN4122E"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E3-06-08", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E3-06-08", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": [{"or": ["TCN2116", "TCN2121", "TCN3124"]}, "TCN3132"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["TCN4124"]}
