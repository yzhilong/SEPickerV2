{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Between the 5th and 10th of June 1967 Israel fought the combined forces of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. The Israeli\u2019s swift victory not only gained them territory but shocked a transnational Arab population whose leaders had announced their military success even as their forces were decimated. \u201cThe setback,\u201d as it was called, was \u201ca total defeat of regimes, institutions, structures, ideas, and leaders\u201d that upended Arabic intellectual and cultural production.
