{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module builds on the module Biomolecules (CM3225) as well as Organic Chemistry (CM 2121). A major focus will be directed towards the identification and chemical optimization of drug molecules. It will be accompanied by presentations and case studies delivered by selected researchers from Pharmaceutical Industry. \nThe following aspects will be covered:\n1)\tThe role of the chemist in the drug discovery process\n2)\tTarget Selection\n3)\tSelection of chemical starting points via virtual     screening techniques\n4)\tDesign of compound libraries\n5)\tTranslation of ADME-Tox data into new chemical entities\n6)\t Intellectual property for medicinal chemists\nThe module is suited for advanced students majoring in chemistry or applied chemistry.", "title": "Medicinal Chemistry", "department": "Chemistry", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "CM2121 and CM3225", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CM4271", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Hybrid_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Hybrid_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Hybrid_B", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CM2121", "CM3225"]}}
