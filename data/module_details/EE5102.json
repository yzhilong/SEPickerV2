{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EE6102 Multivariable Control Systems (Advanced)", "description": "This module covers both classical topics and current techniques in multivariable control system design. It gives students a good understanding of the differences between single loop and multi-loop systems, in terms of both analysis and synthesis. The topics covered include: Principles of single- and multi-loop feedback designs; poles, zeros and stability of multivariable feedback systems; performance and robustness of multivariable feedback systems; control system design using LQR technique, LQG/LTR method, H2 and H-infinity control, and computer aided design software.", "title": "Multivariable Control Systems", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 4, 3], "prerequisite": "[applicable to UG level students only] EE3331C or EE5101; or\n\n[applicable to GD level students only] EE5101, EE5101R or ME5401.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE5102", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["EE3331C", "EE5101", "EE5101R", "ME5401"]}}
