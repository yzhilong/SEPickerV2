{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module examines the role of criticism in the crucial period that had seen it evolve into a social institution: the long eighteenth century. It goes beyond tracing the early history of a critic-function to explore its relation to the emerging public sphere of civil society in which the so-called 'reading revolution' had taken place.
