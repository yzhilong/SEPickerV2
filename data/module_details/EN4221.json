{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module uses major dramatic texts to examine the topic of performance in Elizabethan/Jacobean literature and culture, both of which are marked by a pervasive theatricalization of authority, social categories, and personal identity. Significantly, the culture was also shaped by a theology that identified performance with evil. The module aims to provide students with an understanding of the culture of the period as well as a survey of its drama. The module is designed for advanced undergraduate English majors, preferably those who have taken at least one other module in English literature before 1700.", "title": "Topics in the Seventeenth Century", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2, 7.5], "prerequisite": "Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "EN4221", "semesterData": []}
