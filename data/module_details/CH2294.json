{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module will demonstrate to the students that Chinese religion comprises more than just Buddhism, Daoism, and deity worship. Understanding the interactions that moulded the development of different religious traditions, as well as the syncretism that shaped Chinese culture is part of our focus. On top of surveying the core teachings of the major traditions, this module will also\npay close attention to the effects of religion on all aspects of Chinese life (and afterlife) in China and overseas Chinese communities in SE Asia. The exchanges between Christianity, Islam and Chinese culture will also be studied.", "title": "Religion in Chinese Societies", "department": "Chinese Studies", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 2, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CH2294", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
