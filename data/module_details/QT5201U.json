{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "In this module, various experimental techniques for manipulation of quantum systems will be explored, partly through introductory lectures ,partly through small handson projects. The topics tentatively covered are frequency control of laser systems, homodyne detection techniques, generation of pulse sequences, high voltage techniques, electro-optics, accousto-optics, and liquid crystals for light\nmodulation, basic optical fiber technology, optical cavities\nparaxial optics, and practical aspects of superconducting\nsystems.", "title": "Quantum control technology", "department": "Center for Quantum Technologies", "faculty": "NUS Graduate School", "workload": [1, 1, 2, 4, 2], "prerequisite": "Basic understanding of optics, atomic physics at the undergraduate level, or at the first year of graduate studies.", "corequisite": "Basic programming skills in any of the common languages used for experimental control would be a big plus.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "QT5201U", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "CQT/SR0315", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 10, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "CQT/SR0315", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 10, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1700", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "CQT/SR0315", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 10, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
