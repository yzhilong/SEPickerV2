{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Selected topics from the following will be covered: introduction to surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum; thermodynamic and statistical properties of clean surfaces; interactions between light/ion/electron beams with surface and the surface analysis techniques derived from (including XPS, UPS, IR/Raman, RBS, SIMS, Auger, STM/AFM etc.); electronic, magnetic and optical properties at the surface; surface science in thin films, nanostructures and biomaterials; adsorption phenomena at surfaces; surface processes on nucleation and epitaxial growth; catalysis etc. There are laboratory sessions in this module which contains practice on XPS, SIMS, STM/AFM and IR. This module is targeted at physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering students who already have a basic knowledge of solid-state physics.", "title": "Topics in Surface Physics", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 1, 1, 4], "prerequisite": "Students who have passed either PC4223 or PC4259 or departmental approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PC5205", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 44, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 44, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["PC4223", "PC4259"]}}
