Processes of urbanization have been long shaped by global flows of capital, people, and knowledge.

Topics will range from the effects of maritime trade and colonial expansion on the production of space, the rise of global logistics, the emergence of the idea of  \u201cworld cities,\u201d and recent trends in itinerant urban expertise.", "title": "Global and Transnational Urbanism", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS4247", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-BlackBox", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-CR17", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
