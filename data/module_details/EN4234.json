{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module examines the poetics of information in post-industrial society. The novels of Thomas Pynchon will be read as a critical meta-narrative of the informational turn in Western societies since the 1960s. Besides its obvious technological and economic effects, how has the new informational paradigm affected our psychology, everyday life and work; our understandings of place and community, of history and culture? The seminars will explore key themes of Pynchon\u2019s oeuvre \u2013 such as alienation, entropy and paranoia \u2013 drawing on a wide range of critical theory, cultural history, and critiques of globalisation and technology.", "title": "Pynchon and the Poetics of Information", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN or 28 MCs in EU/LA (French/ German/ Spanish)/ recognised modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "EN4234", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 40, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
