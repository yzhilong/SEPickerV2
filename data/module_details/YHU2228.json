{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This 2000-level course is a broad survey which explores the seismic demographic, economic, cultural and social changes that occurred in the Atlantic basin. Between the fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries the forced and voluntary movement of peoples from Africa and Europe to the Americas occurred on an unprecedented scale. The circulation of commodities and the commodification of human beings spawned a global marketplace, while the circulation of cultural practices and ideas led to the formation of new societies throughout the Atlantic world. All of these changes profoundly reshaped the lives of indigenous Americans, Europeans, and Africans.", "title": "The Atlantic World", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2.5, 7], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU2228", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1030", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1030", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
