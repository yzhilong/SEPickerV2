{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module introduces students to the basics of strategic planning for human service agencies and to the specifics of developing programmes. It considers the development of agency mission and goals, how programmes fit into those goals, how these goals and programmes interact with the environment of the agency and how planners work towards their initial acceptance by stakeholders and significant parts of that environment. Included is an analysis of how planners subsequently evaluate and present their outcomes. Bidding for grants and the presentation of information required to gain the support of funding bodies is an essential focus of the module. Processes within the agency to ensure the success of programmes are considered. Local agency examples are used to illustrate the ideas presented.", "title": "Agency Planning and Development", "department": "Social Work", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "Cohort 2019 and before:\nCompleted 80MCs, including 28MCs in SW of which (i) student must have passed SW1101E, SW2101, SW2104, SW2105, and SW3103A with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards:\nCompleted 80MCs, including 28MCs in SW of which (i) student must have passed SW1101E, SW2101, SW2104, SW2105, and SW3103B with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "SW4220", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT9", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
