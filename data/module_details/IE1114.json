Real engineering systems will be used to show how engineers use different disciplines of engineering, and combine them to design, make and test systems. Through grasping engineering fundamentals, students learn how engineering systems work and fail. Through learning of real systems, students learn how multi-disciplinary concepts are tied together. The students will also learn basic design, experimentation and evaluation of engineering systems.", "title": "Introduction to Systems Thinking and Dynamics", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], "prerequisite": "IE1113 Introduction to Systems Analytics", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "IE1114", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "IE1113"}
