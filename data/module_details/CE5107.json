Students will learn how to use insitu field tests results to obtain appropriate pile design parameters. They will also learn\nhow to appreciate and appraise complex pile foundation problems under various loading and boundary conditions, using both conventional theoretical, semi-empirical as well as advanced numerical modeling techniques (such as UniPile and Plaxis). The course enables students to acquire the knowledge and practical skills through the course project assignments and case studies in the practice of advanced pile design.", "title": "Pile Foundations", "department": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 2, 5], "prerequisite": "Undergraduate: CE2112 & CE3116\nGraduate students: Background in Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CE5107", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "ENG-AUD", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 150, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-04-29T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 150}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CE2112", "CE3116"]}}
