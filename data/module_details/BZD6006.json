{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The seminar in Organizational Theory provides the students with a broad overview of the field as well as an in-depth look at the current debates and the emerging picture in the field. We will read and discuss classical organizational sociology and the emergent fields such as organizational economics, institutional theory, network theory and organizational ecology. The students will be expected to engage in independent reading, interpretation and debate. During the semester, the students will submit two short papers on topics of their choice, and a final term paper with an integrative theme. This paper should demonstrate a deep understanding of the material, an ability to integrate literature, and independent conceptual development.", "title": "Organization Theory", "department": "Strategy and Policy", "faculty": "NUS Business School", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 6], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BZD6006", "semesterData": []}
