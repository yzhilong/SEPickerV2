It provides the theoretical constructs that underpin the development of public health programmes, as well as provides students the opportunity to design a real programme for a specific identified health issue for implementation by a local organisation. The theoretical knowledge and practical skills developed in this module include being able to analyse any given health situation or problem, perform a baseline (via real field exercise), identify and prioritise possible interventions, and develop plans for implementation.", "title": "Designing Public Health Programmes", "department": "SSH School of Public Health Dean's Office", "faculty": "SSH School of Public Health", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 5, 2], "prerequisite": "1.
