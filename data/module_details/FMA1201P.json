The question revolves around whether the meanings people hold about life in general lead to particular leanings in making decisions in life. The seminars do\nnot attempt to define \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 worldviews but aim to generate debate from multiple perspectives according to the expertise and interests of the seminar leader who may be from the student group itself. The seminars include weekly discussions, writing papers, and making individual  presentations.", "title": "FS: Meanings and Leanings: Is There a Reason Why?", "department": "Social Work", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "FMA1201P", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
