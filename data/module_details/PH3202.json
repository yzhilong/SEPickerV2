Is there a necessary connection between law and morality? Must a valid law, or legal system, satisfy certain minimal moral requirements? Is there a moral obligation to obey a valid law, irrespective of its content, or is there a significant difference between moral obligation and legal obligation? How should a judge decide hard cases where no legal rule applies? Should these decisions be based on sound moral considerations? The module will discuss these issues in the light of contemporary debates in legal and political theory, and in the context of some important texts.", "title": "Philosophy of Law", "department": "Philosophy", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PH3202", "semesterData": []}
