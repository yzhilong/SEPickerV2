This module is about information and knowledge as social phenomena. Nature does not tell us how green companies are; the information that shows us \u2018green capitalism\u2019 as a solution and a reality is constructed by humans. This module is about how environmental managers know and do 'greening', and about the problems of such knowing and doing.
