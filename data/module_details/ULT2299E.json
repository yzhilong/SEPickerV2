In other words, good arguments persuade by only relying on logic. They avoid an overreliance on excessive emotional language or on a speaker\u2019s expertise.  This module challenges these understandings of argumentation and demonstrates that logic must be considered in its relation with emotions and \nethics for arguments to be persuasive. Students will begin with the Aristotelian tradition and read contemporary treatments of the issues. Further, students will put rhetorical theory into practice by constructing logical, affective, and ethical arguments.", "title": "Appealing Arguments: Logos, Pathos, and Ethos", "department": "University Scholars Programme", "faculty": "University Scholars Programme", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules. \nUSP Advanced modules (Course-Based Modules, CBMs) may state general pre-requisite skills/knowledge.
