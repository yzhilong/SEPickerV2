{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This graduate level module introduces students to the application of numerical methods for solving incompressible fluid flow and convective heat transfer problems. Major topics covered include: review of theory of numerical discretisation/approximations numerical techniques for elliptic and parabolic PDEs; conservation form; finite-volume discretisation; boundary layer problems; solving Navier-Stokes equations in streamfunction-vorticity and primitive-variables formulations; SIMPLE/R and related procedures; Artificial Compressibility Method; Marker-Cell procedures; steady-state, transient and pseudo-transient methods/approaches. Knowledge in fluid dynamics and heat transfer is presumed. Theory is reinforced by mini-projects. The module is recommended for students who intend to pursue graduate research that requires the application of CFD.", "title": "Computational Fluid Mechanics", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0.5, 0, 4, 3], "prerequisite": "ME2135", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME5302", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Hybrid_A", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2021-04-29T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 150}], "prereqTree": "ME2135"}
