{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module aims to provide an understanding of the relationship between structure and function in tissue biomechanics; introduce quantitative and qualitative assessment of hard and soft tissues in normal and pathological states; inculcate critical and constructive thinking regarding the recent research literature on tissue biomechanics and explore the potential clinical applications. The major topics include mechanical properties of bones, muscles, cartilage, ligaments/tendons, ocular tissues and cardiovascular tissues. Some examples of clinical applications include but are not limited to: tissue growth & remodelling, tendinitis, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, aneurysms, glaucoma, myopia, corneal disorders.", "title": "Tissue Biomechanics", "department": "Biomedical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0.5, 0, 2, 4.5], "prerequisite": "BN2204 Fundamentals of Biomechanics", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BN4201", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "BN2204"}
