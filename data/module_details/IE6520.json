{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module covers contemplary topics in Online Learning, a discipline that lies in the intersection of  achine Learning and Operations Research. Online Learning concerns optimization under uncertainty, using sequentially arriving data. It has applications in online resource allocations, dynamic pricing, online routing control, etc. The module focuses on the algorithm design and analysis in a variety of Online Learning models, with a strong emphasis on the rigorous derivations of the performance guarantees for the presented algorithms. The module is designed for students with research interest in Data-driven\nOptimization and/or Machine Learning.", "title": "Theory and Algorithms for Online Learning", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 4, 3], "prerequisite": "Basic knowledge on probability, particularly on conditional probability and martingales, is required.
