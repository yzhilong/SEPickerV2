It aims to bridge the gap between the elements of probability theory, as taught in early undergraduate level modules, and the basic concepts needed in contemporary signal processing applications. Topics include: general concepts and classification of random variables and\nstochastic processes; transformation of random variables; effects of linear time-invariant filtering on the autocorrelation function and power spectrum of a stochastic process; Gaussian, chi and chi-square statistics; random binary signals, random walk process, Wiener-L\u00e9vy process; Poisson and related processes; random telegraph signals.", "title": "Random Signals", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 2, 5], "prerequisite": "EE2012 Analytical Methods in ECE\nor\nST2334 Probability and Statistics\nand\nEE2023 Signals and Systems", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE4131", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"and": [{"or": ["EE2012", "ST2334"]}, "EE2023"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["EE5139", "EE5133", "EE6735"]}
