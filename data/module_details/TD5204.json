{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course starts where the reliability (REL) course stops. In this course the relation between product quality and reliability with the main operational processes such as product development and manufacturing. In this course especially non-ideal behaviour during development, manufacturing and customer use (including human factors) will be used to explain the imperfections in early life of a product. The stressor-susceptibility concept will be introduced as a mathematical framework for enhanced reliability models.", "title": "Quality & Reliability By Design", "department": "Centre for Design Tech / DTI", "faculty": "Engineering", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "TD5204", "semesterData": []}
