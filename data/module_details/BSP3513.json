{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Family firms are the dominant form of business organization of publicly traded firms everywhere around the world. As such, family firms play an important role in all economies, but especially so in Asian economies, where large family firms often constitute a large part of the private sector. Large Asian family firms - the focus of this course - are often organized into corporate groups, and this type of economic organization has lost its attractiveness in many other parts of the developed world, but continues to be important in most emerging economies. In many ways, the Asian family firm defies the wisdom of strategic management. Its demise continues to be predicted, but does not appear imminent. This course provides students the opportunity to develop deep skills and understanding of the strategy and governance of family firms, and focuses in particular on strategic issues faced by family firms in Asia. Topics include characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of family ownership and management, succession of ownership and leadership, governance of family businesses, and how to grow and sustain the legacy of family business. The knowledge obtained from this course is particularly essential to doing business intelligently with family firms not only in Asia and other emerging economies but also in developed countries.", "title": "Family Business", "department": "Strategy and Policy", "faculty": "NUS Business School", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 4, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BSP3513", "semesterData": []}
