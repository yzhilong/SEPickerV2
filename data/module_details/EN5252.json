{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course involves a critical interrogation of key theoretical approaches addressing the study of film spectatorship and the ways in which subjectivity is constructed. This module adopts a specialised emphasis on that tradition of film theory associated with a psychoanalytical-textual-apparatus model and offers graduate students an opportunity to engage in in-depth explorations of the key problems and issues associated with this branch of film theory. In examining the highly complex interaction between spectator and text, students will also gain a greater understanding of the ways in which issues such as gender, identity, and ideology intersect with the cinematic/visual text.", "title": "Movies, Spectatorship and Subjectivity", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "Must be registered as a Graduate Student in the University or with the approval of the Department", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EN5252", "semesterData": []}
