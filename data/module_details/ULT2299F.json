By looking at its formalist manifestations and political uses, this module first explores what close reading is. We then discuss recent critiques, which has led to alternatives such as: distant reading; reparative reading; surface reading; thin description; just reading; and too-close reading. In so doing, the module raises bigger questions about the \u201cproper function\u201d of analysis. Should it expose and uncover, or \u201cmerely\u201d describe?
