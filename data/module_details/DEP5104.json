Some of the topics covered include why cities exist, why firms cluster, and city growth, land rents and land use patterns, real estate cycles, land use planning, location decisions of firms, industries, and households, roles of local government, public finance and regional competitiveness policies. The prerequisite module is elementary microeconomics. I recommend students who lack this prerequisite knowledge to self-study microeconomics by reading any textbook in economics.
