{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module examines some of the major debates surrounding the \u201cstruggle for recognition\u201d and its relation to the politics of identity and difference. It explores why recognition is an essential human need and how it is foundational to the ways in which we conceive of ourselves and others. It also studies how recognition struggles are often seen as underwriting many contemporary political and social movements, and how they relate to concerns about justice, equality and freedom. Finally, it examines if recognition might, oddly enough, itself become a means of oppression and injustice.", "title": "The Politics of Recognition and Identity", "department": "Political Science", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2, 7.5], "prerequisite": "Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in PS or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "PS4238", "semesterData": []}
