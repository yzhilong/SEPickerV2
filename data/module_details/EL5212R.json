{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module is aimed at graduate students who wish to explore the development of the English language over the past 1,500 years or so, and to see that some features of present-day English can be explained in the light of its history. Students should ideally have some background in grammatical description. Issues that will receive attention include the transformation of a synthetic Old English to a more analytic Modern English; language contact as a force for language change; the standardisation of English; and the spread of English and the New Englishes.", "title": "History of English", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "Must be registered as a Graduate student with the university or with the approval of the department.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "EL5212R", "semesterData": []}
