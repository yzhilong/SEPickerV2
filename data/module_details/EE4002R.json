{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EE4001, EG4301, CG4001", "description": "This research capstone project provides students with an opportunity to work on a complex engineering problem with a strong element of investigative and exploratory research.    It requires   a   confluence   of   knowledge,   skills   and capabilities  in  project  management  and  communications. The project will involve a varied blend of research, design and  development  activities  and is  carried  out  over  two semesters. The project proposal can come from a faculty member  or  student.  It  may  arise  during  the  student\u2019s industrial  attachment  or  as  part  of  an  on-going  research project  and  may  involve  direct  industrial  and  research institutes\u2019  participation.  Students  will  be  assessed individually.", "title": "Research Capstone", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [0, 0, 0, 6, 4], "prerequisite": "Level 4 standing", "moduleCredit": "8", "moduleCode": "EE4002R", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "mpes2": true, "year": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}, {"semester": 3, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}, {"semester": 4, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}]}
