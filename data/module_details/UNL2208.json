{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "How is it possible that only a small number of genes can code for the shape of a tree? Or more generally, where does the complex behaviour so common in the natural \nworld come from? Indeed, how is it conceivable that trillions of neurons create intelligent behaviour? A key to answer these questions lies in interaction and recursion. In this module, the world of complex systems and their fundamental mechanisms are explored through lectures, seminars and hands-on programming. It will be shown how in many cases complex systems can be modelled with recursive processes leading to emergent phenomena that defy an atomic explanation.", "title": "Complexity and Recursion", "department": "University Scholars Programme", "faculty": "University Scholars Programme", "workload": [0, 8, 0, 6, 6], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UNL2208", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
