{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module is designed for graduate students in mathematics.  It covers the following major topics:  Homological algebra: categories and functors, chain complexes, homology, exact sequences, Snake Lemma, Mayer-Vietoris, Kunneth Theorem.  Homology theory:  Eilenberg-Steenrod homology axioms, singular homology theory, cellular homology, cohomology, cup and cap products, applications of homology (Brouwer fixed-point theorem, vector fields on spheres, Jordan Curve Theorem), H-spaces and Hopf algebra.  Manifolds: de Rham cohomology, orientation, Poincare duality.", "title": "Homology Theory", "department": "Mathematics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 2, 5], "prerequisite": "MA5209 or MA5210 or departmental approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MA5236", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["MA5209", "MA5210"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["MA6217"]}
