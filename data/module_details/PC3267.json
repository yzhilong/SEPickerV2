{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module aims to introduce the principles and approaches of physics in the area of molecular biophysics. It includes molecular complexes of biomolecules; physical and symmetrical relationships between biomolecules; physical and structural characteristics of proteins and amino acids; symmetric and statistical descriptions of nucleic acids; first law and second law of thermodynamics in biological systems; bonding and non-bonding potentials, and stabilizing interactions in biomacromolecules, and the correlation to macromolecular structures; molecular mechanics in biological systems; bio soft condensed materials, bio-membrane and biomembrane structure, principles of molecular self assembly of biomolecules. There is a lab component included in this module.  This module is targeted at both physics and non-physics students who already have basic knowledge in physics and life sciences.", "title": "Biophysics II", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 1, 1, 2, 4], "prerequisite": "Students who have passed either PC2131 or PC2267 or EE2011 or Departmental Approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PC3267", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 42, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 42, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["PC2131", "PC2267", "EE2011"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["PC4268", "PC4267"]}
