{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module examines popular media-mediated events \"as\" performance.  The module will investigate the way in which 'mediatised'(i.e. media-mediated) and popular events \"perform\" and shape the audience's perception of reality.  Conversely, the module will also examine how media-mediated performance is influenced by audience interests and perceptions.  The focus will be on popular media-mediated events like sports, reality TV, the internet to illustrate how they constitute different modes of performances while sharing similar performativities.  The module will also focus on cross-genre, inter-disciplinary performances while also examining notions of the spectacular and spectacle in contemporary visual culture.", "title": "Media and Popular Performance", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "TS4219", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "AS8-0401", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
