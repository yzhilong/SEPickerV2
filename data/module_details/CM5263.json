{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Advanced inorganic electronic materials have attracted a lot of interest recently for their unique electronic, mechanical, optical, thermal and chemical properties, and potential applications in future devices. This module covers the theory, synthesis & processing, structure-property relationships, applications and current frontiers, of the four main families of 2D materials: (i) graphene and related materials; (ii) transition-metal dichalcogenides; and (iii) perovskites. Learners will gain the advanced knowledge needed to guide the further development or deployment of these materials in advanced manufacturing, especially in electronics.", "title": "Advanced Inorganic Electronic Materials", "department": "Chemistry", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CM5263", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 120, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
