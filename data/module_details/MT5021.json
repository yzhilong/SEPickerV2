{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Engineering and technology managers often have to deal\nwith problems that go beyond their technical domains.\nThis module introduces engineering students to a\nsystematic methodology of problem-solving. The core of\nthis milestone- based method is a structured process\ncomprising 8 stages as well as the relevant tools and\ntechniques. The emphasis is on providing students with a\ncomplete picture of the whole problem-solving process,\nrather than focusing in depth on certain elements of\nproblem-solving (e.g., creative thinking or decision\nmaking).\nThe module will focus on problems that are multi-faceted,\nwhere solutions are likely to involve trade-offs between\ntechnology, people, process, culture, etc. The module will\nbe conducted in the spirit of experiential learning, and at\nthe same time provide students with the theoretical\nunderstanding of the methodology and its tools and\ntechniques.", "title": "Problem Solving Skills for Engineering Managers", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 5, 2], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MT5021", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 70, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
