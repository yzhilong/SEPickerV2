{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module is about how decisions are made about what services are provided and who receives them. \n\nHealth technology assessment is a well-established tool used when decisions need to be made quickly. Often there is not time for new data collection or a dedicated research effort. It is an exercise in synthesising current evidence and responding appropriately.  Economic evaluation has it foundations in welfare economics and offers a theory based approach to informing choice and trade-offs given resources are scarce. Often new data are required or a more formal research approach is used. Various modelling approaches are used to complete economic evaluations. Some principles of science will be covered such as how hypothesis testing differs from decision making. Other high level issues will be covered such as disruption and non-rational processes and outcomes.", "title": "Health Technology Assessment, Cost-Effectiveness and Decision-making", "department": "Duke-NUS Dean's Office", "faculty": "Duke-NUS Medical School", "workload": [3, 3, 0, 2, 2], "prerequisite": "B.Sc", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GMS5203", "attributes": {"ssgf": true}, "semesterData": []}
