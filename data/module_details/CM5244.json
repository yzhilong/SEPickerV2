{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Environmental chemistry deals with the chemical and biochemical effects of pollutants  in the air, soil and waters, and their remediation.  Students will learn the principles and applications of environmental science, including atmospheric pollution and remediation, land and water pollution and remediation, and regulatory framework.  Students will study cases from SIngapore and the region, and receive practical training in relevant environmental analytical techniques.  This module also covers US Environmental Protection Agency standards and World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water that Singapore\u2019s reclaimed water (NEWater) quality meets or exceeds. EPA's regulations, standards, etc will also cover in Atmospheric chemistry topics. This course will equip students with knowledge and skills for work in the environmental services, including regulatory agencies.", "title": "Topics in Environmental Chemistry", "department": "Chemistry", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 4, 3], "prerequisite": "By Department approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CM5244", "attributes": {"mpes2": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Hybrid_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 100, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
