{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module gives an introduction to the basic physics, the biology and the applications of radiation in medical imaging and radiation therapy. After a review of basic radiation physics and the relevant radiobiology, the currently used major modes of diagnostic and interventional imaging are covered. This will be followed by a discussion of the major methods of radiation cancer therapy (by photons, protons and electrons).", "title": "Radiation for Imaging and Therapy in Medicine", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [4, 0, 0, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "PC1144 Physics IV OR PC1432/PC1432X Physics IIE OR PC2232 Physics for Electrical Engineers OR PC2020 Electromagnetics for Electrical Engineers OR PC2130B Applied Quantum Physics.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PC3295", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["PC1144", "PC1432", "PC1432X", "PC2232", "PC2020", "PC2130B"]}}
