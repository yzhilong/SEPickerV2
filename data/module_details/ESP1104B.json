Particular emphasis will be given to circuits that are used in research and development, such as sensor amplifiers, filters, and data-acquisition. The module has both analogue and digital circuit principles, and involves project activities that involve hands-on construction of sensors, their circuits and translating their signals into digital data on to a computer.", "title": "Sensor System Electronics", "department": "Engineering Science Programme", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 1, 6, 5, 2], "prerequisite": "A-level Mathematics and Physics", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ESP1104B", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1500", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E4-02-01", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1500", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E4-02-01", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E4-02-01", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E4-02-01", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
