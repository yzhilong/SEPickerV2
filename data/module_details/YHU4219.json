This course will consider what Sanskrit and Anglophone philosophers have to say about speech acts. We will start with M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, known as the \u201cscience of sentences\u201d, and think about how commands and exhortations work. We then turn to J.L. Austin\u2019s seminal How to Do Things with Words, which introduced speech act theory to Anglophone philosophy. The course will close with some contemporary attempts to integrate M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and speech act theory.", "title": "Doing Things with Words", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "Two Philosophy modules other than YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 and YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU4219", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"and": ["YCC1113", "YCC1114"]}}
