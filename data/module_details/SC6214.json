{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This is a very advanced course which explores various societal domains in which gender plays a definitive role in structuring the way men and women interact, how it constrains or facilitates opportunities. The emphasis is on making sense of the production and reproduction of gender, gender inequalities and gender politics across a range of societal domains, its institutions and cultural practices ? using insights from micro-sociological and macro-sociological theoretical perspectives. It is crucial to adopt a critical approach towards the intellectual (including sociological) approach to theorizing gender, and the role of feminist theoretical positions in shifting the discourse and effecting concrete changes. The overall aim is to generate amongst students sophisticated and nuanced sociological understandings of how gender is understood in contemporary society, and how it intersects and interacts with race, class, political ideologies and sexuality.", "title": "Gender, Culture and Society", "department": "Sociology", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 4, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SC6214", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "AS7-0102", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 25, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
