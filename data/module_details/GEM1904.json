People with disabilities, children with learning difficulties, the elderly or migrant workers are among them. They face distinct challenges to live independent and productive lives. Each semester, the module focuses on one specific group and examines that group\u2019s challenges, and best practices in Singaporean and international contexts. Engaging with hidden communities in Singapore is one of the key features of understanding global issues in a local context, so-called \u2018Glocalisation\u2019 (globalisation + localisation) to form active citizenship in a healthy society.", "title": "Jr Sem: Hidden Communities", "department": "College of Alice and Peter Tan", "faculty": "Residential College", "workload": [1, 2, 0, 4, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GEM1904", "semesterData": []}
