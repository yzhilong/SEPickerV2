{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "YSC3221 Computer Vision and Deep Learning", "description": "Computer vision is Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on images and video as the input. Images and videos are everywhere and contain rich visual information. However, how can we extract that information? The goal of computer vision is to do this task. In other words, it attempts to make computers work like human eyes: to understand and recognize the world through images or videos. Human visual perception, after millions of years of evolution, is extremely good in understanding and recognizing objects or scenes. To have similar abilities, algorithms based on various cues and techniques (including machine learning) have been developed, and this course is about some of those algorithms.\n\nComputer vision is the most important application of deep learning. Compared to other types of data, images and video are more complex in terms of extracting the underlying information. Recently, it has been shown that deep learning is effective in addressing the problem. Thus, in this course, we will also learn deep learning, particularly in the context of solving computer vision problems.", "title": "Computer Vision and Deep Learning", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "Programming skill in Python, Strong knowledge in mathematics (linear algebra, calculus, probability) and YSC2232 Linear Algebra, or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC4227", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "YSC2232"}
