Each week, students will discuss an aspect of governance and then offer their own thoughts on the subject using their country (or another\ncountry that they have intimate knowledge of) as setting. Towards the end of the course, the student will propose solutions that may help towards achieving better governance in their country.", "title": "Practices in Better and Effective Governance", "department": "LKYSPP Dean's Office", "faculty": "LKY School of Public Policy", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PP5189", "semesterData": []}
