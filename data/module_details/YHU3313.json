{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course focuses on a corpus of 349 diplomatic letters written in cuneiform script on clay tablets which was unearthed in 1887 at Amarna, the short-lived capital of Egypt in the mid-14th century BCE. The letters addressed to the pharaoh Akhenaten by peers and vassals alike are written in Akkadian, a Mesopotamian language which served as the diplomatic lingua franca of the Late Bronze Age Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean. We will examine, with the aid of the Amarna corpus, the Late Bronze Age \u201cinternational\u201d system with especial attention on laws, diplomatic regimes, intelligence activities and conflict resolution.", "title": "The Amarna Letters: Diplomacy in the Late Bronze Age", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 0, 8.5], "prerequisite": "Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
