{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "In the 1880s, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proclaimed the death of God and called for a new life\u2010affirming philosophy to combat the rise of nihilism. Nietzsche, one of the most provocative thinkers of the nineteenth century, lived in an age of cultural tumult and intellectual transformation. This course provides a window into this period through a close engagement with Nietzsche\u2019s writings, including his philosophical works, his personal correspondence, and his autobiography. Attention will also be paid to his friendship and subsequent disillusionment with the composer Richard Wagner.", "title": "Nietzsche: An Untimely Thinker and His Times", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 9.5, 0], "prerequisite": "Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
