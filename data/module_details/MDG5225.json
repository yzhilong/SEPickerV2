{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Molecular imaging becomes indispensable tool for the biomedical research and modern day clinical management.\n\nThis module explores principles of molecular imaging, key imaging equipment used for molecular imaging and examples of applications in clinical management and biomedical research.\n\nBasics of imaging principles will be introduced. Principles of transmission and emission tomography will be explained. Molecular imaging techniques such as nuclear medicine techniques (single photon emission tomography - SPECT, positron emission tomography - PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), optical imaging and hybrid imaging techniques (SPECT/CT, PET/CT, PET/MR) will be covered for both instrumentation principles and applications.\n\nMolecular basis of imaging and molecular imaging probe design will be explained.", "title": "Fundamentals of Molecular Imaging", "department": "NUS Medicine Dean's Office", "faculty": "Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine", "workload": [3, 0.5, 0, 0, 6.5], "prerequisite": "\u201cA\u201d level understanding on physics, chemistry and biology", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MDG5225", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
