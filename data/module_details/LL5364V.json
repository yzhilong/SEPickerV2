The focus is on concepts and principles in which the differences between the civil and common law systems are particularly striking. Examples are the core emphasis on obligations, the lack of a strict or any consideration requirement in contract law, the focus on absolute rights in delictual liability, the concept of negotiorum gestio and the design of property law as positive absolute rights. The different concepts of legislation and jurisprudence also form part of the module.", "title": "Principles of Civil Law: Law of Obligations & Property", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "LL5364V", "aliases": ["LL4364V", "LL6364V"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_D", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Hybrid_D", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Hybrid_D", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
