{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module explores the dynamic relationship between Community Engagement and its stakeholders. We will look at definitions of stakeholders and how they impact the efficacy, direction, processes and perceptions of Community Engagement in Singapore. We will focus on the government, social service agencies, donors, businesses and beneficiaries as we adopt an interdisciplinary approach to analyse how these various stakeholders interact with one another, including examining the role of university students in this diverse ecosystem. Furthermore, we will probe how stakeholders might determine the success of a project, alongside technology's rapidly changing role in community engagement in Singapore.", "title": "Stakeholders: Community Engagement as a Sum of Diverse Parts", "department": "College of Alice and Peter Tan", "faculty": "Residential College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "UTC11%, UTC14%, UTC17% (UTCP Junior Seminar)", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UTS2410", "attributes": {"su": true}, "aliases": ["UTC2414"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "CAPT-SR3", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 8, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2000", "weeks": [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "CAPT-SR1-2", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 8, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "CAPT-SR3", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 8, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2000", "weeks": [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "CAPT-SR1-2", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 8, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
