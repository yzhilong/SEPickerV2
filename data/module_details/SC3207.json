{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Kinship, a foundational concern of anthropology, is essentially about relationships. We investigate the forms, meanings and manipulations of relationships that people have constructed across various historical and cultural contexts. Comparing the diverse ways in which people live, labour and love, we examine the centrality of kinship to understandings of what it means to be a person. Concurrently, kinship is a medium for grappling with the interactions between intimate life and public culture, domestic production-reproduction and political economy, everyday practices and conceptual structures and affection and moral obligations. Our focus is on how kinship is a vital force in contemporary societies.", "title": "Cultures of Kinship", "department": "Sociology", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SC3207", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "D1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "E1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
