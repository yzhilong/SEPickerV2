{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "TM3211, ME3211E", "description": "The module covers topics on: Linear elasticity in which the general equations of equilibrium and compatibility are derived and its applications are illustrated for complex problems; Unsymmetrical bending of beams; Stresses in pressurized thick-walled cylinders in elastic and elasto-plastic regions; Stresses in rotating members; Introduction to mechanics of composite materials; and Experimental stress analysis with particular emphasis on optical methods. This is an elective module and is intended for students in Stage 3 and 4 who have an interest in the stress analysis of isotropic and composite materials. The materials in this module are applicable to chemical, civil, mechanical and aeronautical engineering.", "title": "Mechanics of Solids", "department": "SCALE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Cont and Lifelong Education", "workload": [3, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 4.5], "prerequisite": "TME2114, ME2114E", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "TME3211", "attributes": {"lab": true, "ssgf": true}, "aliases": ["ME3211E"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["TME2114", "ME2114E"]}}
