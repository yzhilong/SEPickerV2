The aim of the module is to show, in a playful way, that this is not (always) the case, that really simple systems ranging from physics, meteorology, engineering, computer science, biology and economics, can have a rich, complex \u2026 and unpredictable behavior. Many notions are at the heart of this module such as determinism versus predictability, chaos, the need for a statistical description, random walks, ergodicity, entropy, fractals, cellular automata, self-organized criticality, emergent behavior, etc.", "title": "SYC: Simple Yet Complex", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [0, 2, 0, 4, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "FMS1212P", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "S16-03-0506", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 15, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
