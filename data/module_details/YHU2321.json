{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "In the wake of the second World War, Oxford philosophers Iris Murdoch, Elizabeth Anscombe and Philippa Foot recognized the imperative for a new mode of moral philosophy, at once ambitious and fully natural. They initiated what became the reclamation of the resources of the Greek tradition, primarily Aristotle, in Anglophone moral thought.\nThis course explores the naturalised rationalism and moral psychology of neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics: What is a virtue?
