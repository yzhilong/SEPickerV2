{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course examines the labor of natural history through the life of Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913). It focuses less on the evolutionary insights of Wallace and more on the historical and material conditions of his work. In this way, it investigates the nexus of science, empire, and infrastructure and how this nexus shaped the contours and collections of natural history work in Southeast Asia. The course seeks to answer: What is \u201cnatural\u201d about natural history? How does natural history work? And why is there a statue of Wallace in front of the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum?", "title": "Alfred Russel Wallace and the Work of Natural History", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2.5, 7], "prerequisite": "Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
