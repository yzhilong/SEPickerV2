{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EU4215", "description": "After the end of empire in what ways does Europe remain indelibly marked by its imperial past? By looking comparatively at several former imperial powers in Europe we consider how the nature of empires and their aftermath vary from country to country. Overarching topics of interest include immigration, race relations, and the construction of national identity in postcolonial Europe. Class material draws from a variety of sources including novels, films, and secondary studies. In addition, students have the opportunity to carryout their own in-depth research project on a related topic. This module is designed for honours year students interested exploring ideas about how the imperial past continues to shape Europe in the present.", "title": "Imperial Legacies in Europe", "department": "History", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2, 7.5], "prerequisite": "Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in HY or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non- language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in HY, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "HY4221", "semesterData": []}
