{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module deals with philosophy by women (eg Christine de Pisan, Hildegaard von Bingen, Mary Wollstonecraft, Ban Zhao, Iris Murdoch, Martha Nussbaum) and philosophy about women, to counter the perceived neglect of these in many philosophical discourses.  Students are encouraged to reflect critically about their own experiences as men and women who live in a gendered world, to think through the implications of gender: how women's experience may challenge some fundamental assumptions regarding human nature, femininity and masculinity, sexuality and the body, public and private life, subjectivity and representation.  We will explore how these challenges to philosophy may be met.", "title": "Women in Philosophy", "department": "Philosophy", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "One PH module", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PH3217", "semesterData": []}
