{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module will focus on the discussion of most recently developed imaging techniques and their application in biological sciences. It is directed towards graduates with basic cell and molecular biology backgrounds. Upon introduction into the technical background of the most relevant modern imaging methods (such as Super-Resolution Microscopy, Cryo-EM, Advanced Confocal Microscopy etc.) graduate students will give presentations on application of these techniques as published in the most recent literature. Reference to own research projects is strongly encouraged. It will be discussed how such techniques can help to\naddress open questions in the student\u2019s research studies.", "title": "Novel applications in Bioimaging Sciences", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [1, 4, 0, 0, 5], "prerequisite": "Students should have basic background in molecular and cell biology, and consent of course lecturers.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BL5226", "semesterData": []}
