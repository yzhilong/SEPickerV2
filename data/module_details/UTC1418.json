A train may get delayed, the favourite soccer team may lose, a stock may dip suddenly. Less likely, but still possible: a common medical procedure may go wrong, or a routine journey may encounter an accident.\n \nThis module looks at reasoning tools which help make sense of probability, risk and uncertainty in every day situations, such as the numerous quantitative stories carried by the mass media. Students will be guided to think and respond critically to these stories. Probability theory will be introduced in a friendly, welcoming way to students from all backgrounds.", "title": "Jr Sem: Chances in Life", "department": "College of Alice and Peter Tan", "faculty": "Residential College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UTC1418", "semesterData": []}
