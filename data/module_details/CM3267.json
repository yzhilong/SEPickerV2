{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module introduces the elements of computational\nthinking and its application in chemistry, energy and the\nenvironment and food science. These elements include\nproblem formulation/abstraction, pattern recognition,\ndecomposition, and finally algorithm design. Direct\napplication of these elements will occur through\nprogramming specifically using Python on a Raspberry Pi\ncomputer. The Raspberry Pi will be programmed to make\nreal-time observations of phenomena relevant to the\nenvironment and/or food science.", "title": "Computational Thinking and Programming in Chemistry", "department": "Chemistry", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 0, 3, 2, 3], "prerequisite": "Either (a) OR (b) below:\n(a) CM2191 Experiments in Chemistry 2 AND\nCM2192 Experiments in Chemistry 3\nOR\n(b) FST2102B Chemistry of Food Components", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CM3267", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "S13-M-09", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 70, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Hybrid_B", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 70, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CM2191", {"or": ["CM2192", "FST2102B"]}]}}
