{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module introduces students to taxonomy and systematics; i.e., the science of grouping biodiversity into species, describing the species, and classifying this\ndiversity into higher-level taxa that reflect evolutionary history. The module has two main goals: (1) It introduces the main concepts and goals of taxonomy and\nsystematics. (2) It teaches the qualitative and quantitative techniques that are today used to describe/identify species and higher-level taxa based on the analysis of\nmorphological and DNA sequence evidence. The aim is to equip environmental as well as other biologists with a thorough understanding of taxonomic/systematic units and the tools needed for evaluating and quantifying diversity in samples of plant and animal specimens.", "title": "Principles of Taxonomy and Systematics", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 1, 1, 2, 4], "prerequisite": "LSM3241 or LSM3252", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LSM4254", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "S2-03LAB7", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 42, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2020-11-28T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["LSM3241", "LSM3252"]}}
