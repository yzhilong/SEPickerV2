Over the last 30 years, psychologists, economists, and business scholars have joined forces to investigate what actually influences people\u2019s decisions. We will use insights from this research program (called \u201cbehavioral science\u201d or \u201cbehavioral economics\u201d) to improve your ability to influence the behavior of others. We will explore many influence tools, from economic incentives to psychological nudges. We will discuss when using these tactics can be effective, as well as when they can fail or even backfire. We will analyze mistakes that people make when trying to influence others, and how you can avoid them.", "title": "Mastering Influence", "department": "BIZ Dean's Office", "faculty": "NUS Business School", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BMA5429", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 3, "timetable": [{"classNo": "P1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-13", "end": "2021-06-17"}, "venue": "BIZ1-0201", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 66, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "P1A", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-13", "end": "2021-06-17"}, "venue": "E-Hybrid_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 66, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "P1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-11", "end": "2021-06-15"}, "venue": "BIZ1-0201", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 66, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "P1A", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-11", "end": "2021-06-15"}, "venue": "E-Hybrid_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 66, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["A", "Unknown"]}]}
