It aims to create an understanding of the environment in which financial reporting choices are made, what the options are and how to use these data in making decisions. Course materials are built around the accounting and reporting issues faced by real companies today, to give students a real business context for understanding the many forces that can affect a company's accounting choices.", "title": "Financial Statement Analysis", "department": "Finance", "faculty": "NUS Business School", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 4, 4], "prerequisite": "FNA1002 or FNA1002X or ACC1002 or ACC1002X or BH1002 or BZ1002 or BK1003 or FNA1002E or BH1002E", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "FIN3113", "aliases": ["FIN3720"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "A1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "BIZ2-0509", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 25, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "A1", "startTime": "0830", "endTime": "1130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "BIZ2-HSSAU", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "A2", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "BIZ2-HSSAU", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["FNA1002", "FNA1002X", "ACC1002", "ACC1002X", "BH1002", "BZ1002", "BK1003", "FNA1002E", "BH1002E"]}}
