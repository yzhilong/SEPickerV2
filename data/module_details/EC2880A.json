Cities enable trade, self-protection and social expression. They also create the need for politics, law and administration. This module introduces students to microeconomic theory, then uses these concepts to investigate urbanism. We discuss why cities form, how cities can succeed, and why some cities fail. We draw examples from both ancient and modern cities, with particular emphasis on cities in Asia.", "title": "Topics in Economics: The Rise and Fall of Great Cities", "department": "Economics", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [4, 0, 0, 3, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EC2880A", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
