{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "ST5318", "description": "The module introduces designed experiment as a tool for process improvements and designing products that are robust to environmental variability. Inferences about the effect of factors on a product or process can be drawn using designed experiment. Topics include analysis of variance of fixed-effect models, randomized block design, factorial designs, fractional factorial designs, blocking and confounding, response surface methodology, random effects models, nested and split-plot designs. Predictive analytics using designed experiments. This module is targeted at students who are interested in designing robust products and process improvements, and are able to meet the pre-requisites.", "title": "Design of Experiments for Product Design and Process Improvements", "department": "Statistics and Applied Probability", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "Departmental approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ST5203", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": []}
