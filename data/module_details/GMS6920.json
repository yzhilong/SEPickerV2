{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "There is an increasing appreciation that the underlying causes of major diseases have a metabolic basis, such as diabetes and cancer. It is thus becoming necessary for scientists and physicians to have a foundation in\nintermediary metabolism in order to better understand the etiology of diseases and develop novel strategies for treating diseases.\n\nThis 4-credit course offered at Duke-NUS will cover the basics in intermediary metabolism and the regulation of metabolism with special emphasis on human diseases related to metabolic dysfunction and adaptation. This\ncourse is tailored for students interested in cancer biology, diabetes, and for those students that have an interest in obtaining a general background in the biochemistry of metabolism.\n\nThe class format will involve a combination of lectures and discussion and meet twice a week. Grading will be based on tests and a student presentation on a relevant research article.", "title": "Metabolic Basis of Disease", "department": "Duke-NUS Dean's Office", "faculty": "Duke-NUS Medical School", "workload": [6, 0, 0, 0, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GMS6920", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}]}
