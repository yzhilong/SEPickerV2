{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Survival in the biological world depends on the organism\u2019s ability to adapt and evolve with its environment. This is well established in fungi \u2013 which have existed for more than 500 million years and are represented by about 100,000\nrecorded species from all corners of the earth. Fungi exhibit  adaptive  'strategies'  that have enabled them to colonise harsh biological conditions and even other living organisms for their continued survival. Students will delve into these amazing strategies seen in successful fungal communities. Through seminars and debates, students will hone skills in researching and processing information, critical analysis, presentation; and draw relevant parallels through introspection.", "title": "Adapt, Evolve and Survive: The Fungal Story", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [0, 2, 0, 0, 8], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "FMS1228B", "semesterData": []}
