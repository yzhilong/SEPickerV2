The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to game theory, studying basic concepts, models and solutions of games and their applications.\n\n\n\nMajor topics: Games of normal form and extensive form; Applications in Economics; Relations between game theory and decision making. Games of complete information: Static games with finite or infinite strategy spaces, Nash equilibrium of pure and mixed strategy; Dynamic games, backward induction solutions, information sets, subgame-perfect equilibrium, finitely and infinitely repeated games. Games of incomplete information: Bayesian equilibrium; First price sealed auction, second price sealed auction, and other auctions; Dynamic Bayesian games; Perfect Bayesian equilibrium; Signaling games. Cooperative games: Bargaining theory; Cores of n-person cooperative games; The Shapley value and its applications in voting, cost sharing, etc.", "title": "Game Theory", "department": "Mathematics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "(MA3236 or MA3252 or DSC3214 or DSN3701) and (MA2216 or ST2131 or ST2334)", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MA4264", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "3", "startTime": "1100", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1700", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1900", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 140, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1900", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2021-05-05T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 150}], "prereqTree": {"and": [{"or": ["MA3236", "MA3252", "DSC3214", "DSN3701"]}, {"or": ["MA2216", "ST2131", "ST2334"]}]}}
