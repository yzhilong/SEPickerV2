{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The course provides an overview of the petrochemical industry, with a focus on the Singapore industry. The processes that are covered include crude oil composition, refining, steam reforming, and steam cracking, along with applications of syngas (ammonia, methanol and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis). Important heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic processes, and derivatives from C1 to C6 base chemicals are also covered. To provide an in-depth understanding, fundamentals of the chemical synthesis, processes, catalysis, kinetics, thermodynamics and reactor design will be highlighted.", "title": "Petrochemicals and Processing Technology", "department": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2.5, 0.5, 0, 1, 6], "prerequisite": "CN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN2121: Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CN4211R", "attributes": {"lab": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2021-04-30T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CN2116", "CN2121"]}}
