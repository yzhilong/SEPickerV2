{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This gateway to the Specialization in Public Management and Leadership focuses on the ways in which public managers and leaders mobilize resources to achieve important public purposes. In the module, we will discuss the roles and responsibilities of managers in the design, implementation, and evaluation of public programmes and policies. Since leaders try to anticipate and manage change strategically, they must have an appreciation of the integrative, interdependent nature of organizations, their environments, and their stakeholders. We will pay specific attention to the uniqueness of the public sector environment, and the relation between public managers and political principals and stakeholders. Required readings and cases represent a balanced mix of classical and recent materials and studies from around the globe, including Asia, USA, Europe and Africa.", "title": "Foundations of Public Management (Gateway)", "department": "LKYSPP Dean's Office", "faculty": "LKY School of Public Policy", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 4, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PP5415", "semesterData": []}
