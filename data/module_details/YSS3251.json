{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Contemporary cities face pressing environmental and infrastructural challenges that unevenly shape the nature of urban space and everyday life. This course introduces students to urban political ecology (UPE) as an interdisciplinary field of inquiry for examining critical socio-ecological processes and problems in cities. Through UPE case studies on water, waste, pollution, green spaces, environmental (in)justices, and smart/sustainable cities, we consider interwoven social, political and ecological processes that produce differing urban environments for city-dwellers. This course provides a critical toolkit for grasping and analyzing the complex human-environment networks that constitute our cities, while considering possibilities for greater social and environmental justice.", "title": "Urban Political Ecology", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS3251", "semesterData": []}
