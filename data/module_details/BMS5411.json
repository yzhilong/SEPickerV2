In an organisation, the decisions you make will impact outcomes for you, your team, and cumulatively affect the trajectory of your career. This module aims to help you navigate the pathways of decision making in organisations. We will adopt an evidence-based approach, tapping several streams of research \u2013 including behavioural psychology and economics, error management, and intuitive judgment \u2013 to give a rigorous account of what separates good decisions from the rest.
