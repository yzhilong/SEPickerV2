{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course is aimed at doctoral students who intend to conduct experimental and quasi-experimental research for the study of individuals\u2019 behavior in business (e.g., marketing, organizational behavior) and related disciplines (e.g., psychology). Topics include factorial designs, repeated (within-subject) and mixed designs, analysis of covariance, and mediation analysis. Importantly, the course examines these designs and analyses from the perspective of an applied behavioral researcher, not from that of a statistician. That is, the course emphasizes the actual use of proper data collection procedures and analyses techniques for rigorous theory testing instead of focusing on statistical theory per se.", "title": "Experimental Methods for Behavioral Research", "department": "BIZ Dean's Office", "faculty": "NUS Business School", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 4, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BZD6012", "semesterData": []}
