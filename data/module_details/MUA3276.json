{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module introduces concepts and strategies for realizing compositions from the American experimental tradition and European avant-garde, including works by\nCage, Feldman, Lucier, Stockhausen, and Cardew, amongst others. Performing a work from this tradition requires skills not developed for the performance of\nWestern classical music since indeterminacy, new notational approaches, and unique aesthetic goals are frequently involved. Students will gain an understanding of how to address these issues through performance of selected repertoire. A collection of readings by composers in this tradition exposes the student to the aesthetic underpinnings of the works encountered.", "title": "Experimental Music Realizations", "department": "YSTCM Dean's Office", "faculty": "YST Conservatory of Music", "workload": [0, 2, 0, 0, 3], "moduleCredit": "2", "moduleCode": "MUA3276", "semesterData": []}
