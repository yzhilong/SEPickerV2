{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This is the first of a series of two 2-semesters long modules intended to allow students to pursue a project of their interest under the supervision of a faculty mentor. The idea is to allow students to follow their aspirations and work towards an impactful goal. The project may be carried out within or outside NUS and may last more than one semester. It may or may not be confined to engineering disciplines, but it should have a clear articulation of possible impact on society or community life. This module can only be read by students of the EScholars Programme.", "title": "Aspirational Project I", "department": "FoE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [0, 0, 0, 14, 6], "moduleCredit": "8", "moduleCode": "EG2701A", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}]}
