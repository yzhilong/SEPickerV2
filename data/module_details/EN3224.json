{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Drawing from all three genres of fiction, drama and poetry, this module presents a survey of anglophone literature in the 20th-century. We explore the writing of this century through two of its most important literary paradigms, namely the literary modernism of the early decades and the postmodern era following WWII. Students will encounter a century characterised by extensive aesthetic innovation, active political engagement and the acute registering of social change. Subjects covered include modernism, postmodernism and issues of art, language and representation. Writers we study may include T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, Harold Pinter, Jeanette Winterson and Virginia Woolf.", "title": "The Twentieth Century", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "(i) EN1101E AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)", "corequisite": "So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EN3224", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["EN1101E", {"or": ["EN2201", "EN2202", "EN2203", "EN2204", "EN2205", "EN2207", "EN2275", "EN2276", "EN2277"]}]}}
