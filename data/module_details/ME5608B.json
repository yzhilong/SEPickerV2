{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "ME5608: Additive and Non-Conventional Manufacturing Processes", "description": "This introductory module emphasizes on hybrid manufacturing techniques. This will focus on how to use two or more non-conventional material additive and removal processes in macro, micro and nano-scale to machine features. Topics include: bio-micro printing, chemicalmechanical polishing (CMP), electrical-chemical machining (ECM), ultra-precision diamond turning (UPDG), Electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID) grinding, laser-based machining, Ultrasonic Machining, Abrasive Machining Processes, etc. Students are expected to carry out an independent study by project or term paper on the related topics. A structured programme of lectures, term papers, and a final examination are included in this module.", "title": "Hybrid Manufacturing", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 0, 0.5, 0, 2.5], "moduleCredit": "2", "moduleCode": "ME5608B", "attributes": {"lab": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 20, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-12-02T05:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 60}]}
