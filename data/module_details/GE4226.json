{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module offers students theoretical and applied understandings of mobilities as a productive site of social life and culture. Drawing perspectives from the \u2018new\u2019 mobilities paradigm, it demonstrates how movement is not a sterile activity or zone, but a space replete with meaning. To exemplify this point, this course takes transportation as a lens of analysis, and interrogates its socio\u2010cultural organization and experience. Three aspects will be emphasized, namely the identities and embodiments latent in transportation; the infrastructures of transit; and the (geo)politics of mobility. Case studies will be drawn internationally, including Asia.", "title": "Mobile Spaces: Making Social Worlds", "department": "Geography", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 4, 5.5], "prerequisite": "Cohort 2019 and before: Completed at least 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track. \n\n(Global Studies students) Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed at least 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "GE4226", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1500", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 51, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
