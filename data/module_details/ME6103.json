{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "With the growing need for non-contacting whole-field measurement and inspection, the development\nand implementation of optical techniques have rapidly become major activities in universities, research\ninstitutions and industries. This module aims to provide a good foundation and understanding of these\ntechniques for research and industrial applications. Topics to be covered include: Depth gauging using\nlaser triangulation. Surface contouring using Moire techniques. Displacement measurement and\nsurface contouring using holography. Surface strains and slope measurements using shearography.\nSurface profiling and deformation measurement using projection grating. Nondestructive testing and\nsurface quality inspection.", "title": "Optical Measurement and Quality Inspection", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0.5, 2, 4.5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME6103", "semesterData": []}
