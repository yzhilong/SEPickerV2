{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module introduces different modes of human robot interactions, methods for detecting humans, understanding human behaviors and intentions, and methods for humanrobot coordination and collaboration. Human-robot interactions include physical and non-physical (e.g. social) interactions. Physical interactions include human assistance and wearable robotics. Non-physical interactions include natural language understanding, spoken dialogue, gestures and \u201cbody language\u201d, and multimodal interaction fusing different interaction modalities. Human-robot coordination and collaboration include human-robot handovers, robotic assistants and coworkers. User interface design for mutual communications between robot and humans is covered, including social interaction. Several applications and scenarios will be included.", "title": "Human-Robot Interaction", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0.5, 0.5, 2, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE4705", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": []}
