{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module considers cultural production as an arena of contestation for voice and visibility. It explores how creative performances and productions have been\nused to express, subvert, or redefine social realities and values, constitute publics, and initiate change. A variety of forms, such as street theatres, music,\ncartoons, community and online media, will be explored through an anthropological engagement with the everyday politics of recognition, narration,\nbelonging, and indeed the valuation of one\u2019s voice. Power, performance, agency, creativity, audiences, art worlds and aesthetics are among the key concepts explored.", "title": "Cultural Production: Power, Voice, Policies", "department": "Sociology", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "SC4226", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1500", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
