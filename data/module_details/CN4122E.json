{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "TCN4122", "description": "This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical\nprocesses.", "title": "Process Synthesis and Simulation", "department": "SCALE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Cont and Lifelong Education", "workload": [2, 2, 0, 1.5, 2], "prerequisite": "CN2116E Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN2121E Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics\nCN3124E Particle Technology\nCN3132E Separation Processes", "moduleCredit": "3", "moduleCode": "CN4122E", "aliases": ["TCN4122"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E3-06-08", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 10, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E3-06-08", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 10, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CN2116E", "CN2121E", "CN3124E", "CN3132E"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["CN4123E", "CN4124E"]}
