{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This class will cover the fundamental and physical basis of plastic/inelastic deformation and other dissipative processes. Here we will develop continuum-based isotropic plasticity and crystal-plasticity-type constitutive equations through a rigorous thermodynamic approach. The first part of the course will be devoted to the teaching of continuum mechanics/balance laws/thermodynamics, the second part will focus on the development of constitutive equations for plasticity and the third part will concentrate on the application of plasticity theory through numerical techniques.", "title": "Plasticity and Inelastic Deformation", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 6, 1], "prerequisite": "ME6105: Continuum mechanics (Pre-requisite)", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME6107", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "ME6105"}
