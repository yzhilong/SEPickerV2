In this module, students will learn how to conduct their own astronomical observations and relate that experience to the various modes of thinking and philosophy behind astronomy and astrophysics. Students will also have the opportunity to communicate their experiences and ideas with their peers and a wider audience.", "title": "Sky and Telescopes", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 3, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GET1042", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "mpes2": true, "su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1900", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 100, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 56, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 56, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1900", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], "venue": "", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 112, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
