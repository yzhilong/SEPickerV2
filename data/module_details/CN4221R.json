{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module will give students sound knowledge and appreciation of the development of plant-wide control (PWC) systems for chemical processes. The course will cover the systematic design of a regulatory control system with the aid of heuristics and computer-aided simulation tools. Students will be introduced to dynamic (real-time) simulation of chemical processes. Active learning techniques will be employed throughout. As part of the assessment, students will get to work hands-on with a project to design and simulate PWC systems for a chemical plant. Students are also assessed by means of a class test, and small individual assignments.", "title": "Control of Industrial Processes", "department": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2.5, 1, 0, 3.5, 3], "prerequisite": "CN3121: Process Dynamics and Control\nCN4122: Process Synthesis and Simulation", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CN4221R", "attributes": {"lab": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT4", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 100, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT4", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 100, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT4", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 100, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["CN3121", "CN4122"]}}
