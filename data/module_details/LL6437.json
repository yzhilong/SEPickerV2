Theories of democracy commonly hold that the acceptance of rule of law in non-democratic countries would lead to democratization, especially along with increasing economic prosperity. This linear thesis, however, have met challenges recently in light of recent developments in China, HK, and other parts of the world. As such, this module scrutinizes this linear thesis by examining the trajectories of legal development in East Asia and the determinants, such as international factors, civil law traditions, legal professionals, foreign law influence, colonial legacies and post-colonial nationalism.", "title": "Law and Democracy in East Asia", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LL6437", "semesterData": []}
