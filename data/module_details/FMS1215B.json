Students will also learn how to recognize\nsymptoms caused by various plant pathogens and\nmethods of plant disease investigation. There will be\ndiscussions on plant disease detection and diagnosis,\nplant pathogen-host interactions and development of\ndisease resistant plants using transgenic techniques.\nStudents will explore the origins of plant pathogens and\ntheir evolution, agricultural crops as food, transgenic crops\nand food safety issues related to plant diseases.
