{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The urban environment presents very different conditions from which plants have evolved in their natural environment. For plants to in urban areas, two specific general conditions need to be fulfilled: creating favourable growing conditions and use of appropriate landscape design for plants to thrive. This module focuses on (1) understanding unique growing urban conditions, covering aspects such as urban temperatures, water, nutrients, light and soil, (2) design of planting areas to satisfy growth needs, (3) understanding the large diversity of plants suitable for different urban conditions, (4) planting design to ensure plants can thrive in urban areas.", "title": "Planting Design and Horticulture", "department": "Architecture", "faculty": "Design and Environment", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 1, 6], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LAD2004", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "SDE4-GIS1-2", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 20, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
