{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module provides an overview of the general failure mechanisms in integrated circuits and three MOS technology specific reliability mechanisms (i.e., CMOS latchup, gate oxide reliability and hot carrier reliability). A brief introduction on the failure analysis methodology will also be covered. At the end of this module, students will gain a basic understanding of the various failure/reliability issues in silicon devices.  Topics covered: Introduction to IC Failure Analysis. General failure mechanisms in integrated circuits: Bonding, packaging and metallization failures. Electrical stress failures: electromigration and ESD/EOS. Technology specific reliability mechanisms: CMOS latchup, gate oxide reliability and hot-carrier reliability.", "title": "Silicon Device Reliability", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 1, 0.5, 0, 6.5], "prerequisite": "EE2021", "corequisite": "EE4411 or equivalent", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE4408", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "EE2021"}
