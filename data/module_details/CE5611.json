This module provides students with fundamental approaches in designing precast concrete components\nand structures. The students will acquire fundamental knowledge and approaches to section analysis and design, design of connections, floor diaphragm action,\nprecast frame structures and precast components. The module is targeted at MSc civil engineering students and those with a keen interest on precast concrete\ntechnology.", "title": "Precast Concrete Technology", "department": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 1, 6], "prerequisite": "CE 3165 or CE4 standing or higher", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CE5611", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UTSRC-LT53", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 120, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-04-26T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 150}]}
