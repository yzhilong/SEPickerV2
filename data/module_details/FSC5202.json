{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module brings in cross-disciplinary practical expertise from the Unconventional Threats Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which acts as our first line of defence against terrorism to detect threats from chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive materials (CBRNE threat materials). Effective anti-terrorism measures utilising new methodologies customised and optimised for forensic use in order to provide fast and accurate detection and identification of CBRNE threat materials will be shared. Students will get the\nrare opportunity to experience first-hand the applications learnt at MHA\u2019s operational forensic laboratories at checkpoints. Relevant underlying scientific principles will be augmented by internal faculty members. Students will also be exposed to a holistic view of the laws and international conventions involving\nCBRNE threat materials.", "title": "Forensic Defense Science", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 1, 1, 3, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "FSC5202", "attributes": {"lab": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "S1A-0217", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
