{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course will present selected topics in applied human factors engineering to extend the theories and methods discussed in IE2150, such as anthropometry,\nbiomechanics, work physiology, human information processing, workplace and interface design, environmental analysis, social and affective factors. The course will be introduced with a review of human factors engineering purpose, scope and methods. Next, a series of case studies will be presented on aviation, control rooms,\nmanufacturing, transportation, office work, environmental safety, ageing, accident investigation and system design. Each module will include the case study, a description of the human factors methods and group based exercises related to the topic.", "title": "Human Factors Engineering: Cases and Tools", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 5, 2], "prerequisite": "IE 2150 Human Factors Engineering and Design", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "IE4252", "semesterData": []}
