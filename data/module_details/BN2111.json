EPP modules aim to introduce first year students to the biomedical engineer\u2019s way of thinking and addressing problems. A real-life medical technology will be used to demonstrate the fundamental knowledge and skills that a biomedical engineer is expected to possess. In EPP II, students will be exposed to key engineering problems such as how systems are controlled, powered and optimized.", "title": "Biomedical Engineering Principles and Practice II", "department": "Biomedical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 2, 0, 0, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BN2111", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "W1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "EA-02-11", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "W2", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E5-03-20", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT7A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 160, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "W3", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "EA-02-11", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "W4", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "EA-06-02", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
