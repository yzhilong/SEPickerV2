{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods widely used for classification. An SVM discriminates between two classes by generating a decision boundary that optimally separates classes after transforming the input data into a high-dimensional space. SVMs are popular because they are memory efficient and can address a large number of predictor variables. In this course, participants will learn how to build and implement SVMs, and assess their performance. The versatility of SVMs is demonstrated through practical applications.", "title": "Learning from Data: Support Vector Machines", "department": "Statistics and Applied Probability", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [5, 4, 0, 6, 5], "prerequisite": "Passed DSA5831 Learning from Data: Principles and Practice", "moduleCredit": "1", "moduleCode": "DSA5842", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1900", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": {"start": "2020-08-13", "end": "2020-11-19"}, "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}, {"semester": 4, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1900", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": {"start": "2021-06-22", "end": "2021-07-27"}, "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": "DSA5831"}
