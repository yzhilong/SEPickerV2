{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "In this module, several selected advanced topics in mechatronics that are of current research interest will be offered. Each student has to choose two of those topics. Topics covered are typically in the areas of robotics, control, machine vision, and artificial intelligence. Each topic chosen will require the student to read several research papers, write a term paper and do a term project. The module is mainly meant for research students to help them specialise in selected topics in mechatronics. ME6401 will be offered in Term I while ME6402 will be offered in Term II. The two modules typically cover a different set of topics.", "title": "Topics in Mechatronics 1", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": "A good background in the topics selected", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME6401", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
