{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course explores encounters with and reflections on death in medieval literature, asking how we make sense of death and what role the dead play in shaping the social world of the living. How should we orient ourselves toward death, an event absolutely certain yet fundamentally unknowable? How might we bridge the gap between the dead and the living? We will examine such questions within the historical context of medieval Europe, considering shifting beliefs about death and afterlife; ancestors, revenants, cultural memory; the devastation of the Black Plague; and the particular possibilities literature offers in structuring our experience of death.", "title": "Death, Mourning and Memory in Medieval Literature", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2 or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU3345", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1930", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-ELMCL", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1930", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-ELMCL", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["YCC1111", "YCC1112"]}}
