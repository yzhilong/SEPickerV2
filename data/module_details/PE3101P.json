Both\ntheories are controversial for their highly quantitative\nnature, their demanding conception of rationality and\nrightness, their insensitivity to risk and inequality, their\nprioritization of ends over means, and their tenuous\nrelationship to actual human behaviour and morality.\nThese controversies are discussed.", "title": "Decision and Social Choice", "department": "Philosophy", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "GEM2006/GET1028 Logic", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PE3101P", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "W1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["GEM2006", "GET1028"]}}
