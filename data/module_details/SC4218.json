{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module is designed to develop a nuanced understanding of forms of religiosity in the present. One aim of the module is to explore connections between the realms of religion and politics, particularly within the framework of secular states. The module examines the notions of \u2018secularity\u2019 and \u2018post\u2010secularity\u2019 and queries their relevance for the contemporary moment, within a comparative, historical perspective. Is it useful to invoke the concept of \u2018secularism\u2019 to make sense of encounters between religious and political domains? Do the ideas\nof the \u2018separation of church and state\u2019 and \u2018state non-interference in religion\u2019 help in these efforts?", "title": "Religions, Secularity, Post-Secularity", "department": "Sociology", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC, or 28 MCs in PS, or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC, or 28 MCs in PS with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "SC4218", "semesterData": []}
