{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course aims to provide tools and training to recognize and formulate models for optimisation purposes subjected to constraints in manufacturing, engineering, finance, supply chain etc. It focus to equip students with the confidence and capability to recognise a problem that can be formulated as a linear programming model, thereafter formulating an appropriate objective function subjected to fitting constraints. For simple problems, a global optimum can be found using CPLEX but for complex problems, metaheuristics will be introduced to search for an optimum solution. Emphasis will be placed on implementation and deliverables while theory will be taught as a supplement.", "title": "Optimisation Modelling and Applications", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [0, 0, 3, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "IE5604", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
