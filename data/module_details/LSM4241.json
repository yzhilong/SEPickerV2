{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module aims to introduce selected topics on functional genomics. Areas covered include : the assignment of functions to novel genes following from the genome-sequencing projects of human and other organisms; the principles underlying enabling technologies: DNA microarrays, proteomics, protein chips, structural genomics, yeast two-hybrid system, transgenics, and aspects of bioinformatics and its applications; and to understand the impact of functional genomics on the study of diseases such as cancer, drug discovery, pharmacogenetics and healthcare.", "title": "Functional Genomics", "department": "Biochemistry", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 2, 5], "prerequisite": "LSM3231 or LSM3241", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LSM4241", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "MD7-02-03", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "MD7-02-03", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-04-28T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["LSM3231", "LSM3241"]}}
