{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The lectures and subsequent tutorials and/or discussions will allow in-depth survey and critical analysis of molecular genetics, beginning with basic principles and extending to modern approaches and special topics. The module will draw on examples from various systems such as Drosophila, C. elegans, yeasts, human, plants and bacteria. The module encompasses advanced treatment of the Central Dogma of molecular biology and covers recent developments in the molecular understanding of genetic information transfer from DNA to RNA to protein, using current examples. Building upon this platform, the module will then proceed to special topics such as Prions, epigenetics, modular signaling cascades, ion channels, membrane dynamics and cellular energetics. It will also provide a broad overview of Protein folding and function.\nIntended primarily for new graduate students familiar with basic molecular biology and genetics", "title": "Advanced Molecular Genetics", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 3, 0, 0, 4], "prerequisite": "Basic knowledge in molecular biology and genetics", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BL5223", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}]}
