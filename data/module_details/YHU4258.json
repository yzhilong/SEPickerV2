{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This seminar focuses on the American television situation comedy, from its origins in the 1940s to the present. We read television history, visual media theory, and perform close analyses of individual episodes, paying particular attention to such themes as class, gender, family, fantasy, race, sexuality, and war. We consider how sitcoms blend political progressiveness with maintaining the status quo, as they attempt to balance courting hip audiences with ensuring wide viewership. We also note moments when episodes foreground their formal qualities, allowing us to better understand them as works of art.", "title": "TV Sitcom", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "All Year 1 and 2 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU4258", "semesterData": []}
