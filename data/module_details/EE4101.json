{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Radio and microwave systems are used for information transmission.  This module therefore introduces the student to a broad range of enabling knowledge and skills commonly employed by RF and microwave engineers to specify, analyse and design radio and microwave transmission systems.  Topics covered:  Time-varying EM fields: guided waves, evanescent modes and plane-wave propagation. Radiation: radiation mechanism, magnetic vector potential, current distribution on a thin wire, Hertzian dipole, Half-wave dipole & monopole. RF Antennas: parameters, aperture antennas and arrays.  RF Amplification: stability, gain and small-signal narrowband design.  RF Generation:  conditions for oscillation, oscillator design and dielectric resonators.   RF Receivers:  receiver and mixer parameters.  RF Systems: system gain and noise figure, satellite and terrestrial systems.", "title": "RF Communications", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 2, 4.5], "prerequisite": "PC2020", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE4101", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E1-06-08", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Packaged Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E1-06-09", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Packaged Tutorial", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2020-11-26T05:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": "PC2020", "fulfillRequirements": ["EE5303", "EE5801"]}
