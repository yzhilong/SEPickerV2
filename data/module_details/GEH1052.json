Students use a variety of tools to analyse language in terms of phonetics, lexis, grammar, and meaning in context. We ask questions such as the following: (1) Why does the idea of \u2018standard language\u2019 appeal to human cultures?; (2) What does \u2018standard English\u2019 comprise?;  (3) What happens to the shape of English when local culture is blended in?  (4) Are \u2018native speakers\u2019 really native?;  (5) Does 'Standard Singapore English' exist?", "title": "Standard English Across Cultures", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GEH1052", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 4, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}]}
