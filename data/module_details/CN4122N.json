{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "CN4122 Process Synthesis and Simulation", "description": "This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical processes. This module is only available to non-graduating students, by invitation from the Department.", "title": "Process Synthesis and Simulation", "department": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 2, 0, 4, 2], "prerequisite": "Host department will access whether students meet pre-requisite on a case-by-case basis.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CN4122N", "semesterData": []}
