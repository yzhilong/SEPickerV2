The course applies a life-course perspective to critically explore the issues affecting the health of mothers, young children and adolescents. We will examine the socioeconomic, behavioural and political determinants of maternal, child and adolescent health, as well as policies, programs and services to reach them. The challenges, strategies and potential innovations to more effectively improve their health and wellbeing will be a major focus.
