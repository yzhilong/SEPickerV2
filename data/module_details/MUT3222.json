{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module provides an overview of various compositional approaches to choral music. Styles surveyed range from English madrigals to popular \u2018a capella\u2019 styles, and diverse modern composers such as Ligeti and Whitacre. Assignments will feature creative choral composition, arrangement, paying attention to details of idiomatic voicing, practical voice leading, text setting, and accompaniment.\n\nThe module aims to bridge compositional thinking with performance and interpretative analysis. Thus, analysis, composition, and performance are represented as modes of learning. Major assessment is in the form of analytical work and music compositions that are performed in class and/or public concerts.", "title": "Choral Composition", "department": "YSTCM Dean's Office", "faculty": "YST Conservatory of Music", "workload": [1, 2, 0, 5, 2], "prerequisite": "MUT 1101: Intro to MCM\n(Or Placement Test for NUS students)", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MUT3222", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": []}
