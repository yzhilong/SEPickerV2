In order to do that, we\u2019ll want to get a firm grounding on what an economist\u2019s lens looks like. We\u2019ll run through the main principles of economic thought. \n\nAfter this introduction to economic thinking, we\u2019ll look at how the principles of economics are applied in specific legal contexts. For these basic applications, we shall take examples from four courses (Property, Contracts, Torts, Criminal Law) to see how an economist might approach these problems.\n\nFollowing on from these basic applications, we\u2019ll look at various extensions to the basic model and special topics.", "title": "The Economic Analysis of Law", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "prerequisite": "NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "LL4159V", "semesterData": []}
