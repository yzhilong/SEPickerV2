{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.", "description": "This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can \nprovide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach.  \n\nThis module focuses on quantifying aspects of nuclear risks. Students will pose a question related to nuclear risks (e.g. What is the lowest dose of radiation that can lead to cancer?), propose a method to measure the relevant variables, collect the necessary data, and make scientifically justifiable inferences from it. Students will thus perform all aspects of a genuine scientific study, from problem formulation to decision making and final reporting.", "title": "Quantitative Reasoning Foundation: Quantifying Nuclear Risks", "department": "University Scholars Programme", "faculty": "University Scholars Programme", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.", "corequisite": "Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UQF2101G", "semesterData": []}
