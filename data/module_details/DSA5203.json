{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course aims at presenting the fundamentations and\nimportant computational algorithms that are very related to\nimportant applications in visual information processing and\nanalysis: from image acquisition to processing, and to\ninterpretation/understanding. The emphasis is on the tight\nintegration of mathematical foundations, numerical\nalgorithms, and programming implementation techniques\nrelated to industrial applications.\n\nMajor topics include: fundamentals for pictorial data\nacquisition and processing, Computational method for 3D\nreconstruction, Visual data categorization and\nsegmentation, computational methods for visual learning\nand their applications in pattern analysis.", "title": "Visual Data Processing and Interpretation", "department": "Mathematics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [4, 0, 0, 2, 4], "prerequisite": "MA4230 or departmental approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "DSA5203", "attributes": {"ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Saturday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 200, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-23T05:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 150}], "prereqTree": "MA4230"}
