{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course examines modernist novels from the period 1910 to 1939 in the light of gender politics and sexual difference that formulate an aesthetic based on radicalised models of subjectivity and sexuality\u2014including the New Woman, the fl\u00e2neuse, and the lesbian. Gender manifests itself in a variety of experiments with writing and being in the world, from literary naturalism to highly complex modernist forms. To ground the textual manifestations of gender, every novel will be paired with texts drawn from philosophy, phenomenology, and cognitive studies, with focus on the representation of consciousness, affect and perception, and literary geography.", "title": "Modernist Women\u2019s Writing: 1910-1939", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1, YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2 and YHU3210% Proseminar in Literary Studies or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU4257", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"and": [{"or": ["YCC1111", "YCC1112"]}, "YHU3210"]}}
