It also addresses the \u201cheadscarf controversy\u201d that has erupted in France in the 1980s, and the linkages between the \u201cveil\u201d, agency, Islam, and secular modernity.", "title": "Topics in PT: Orientalism and Femininity", "department": "Political Science", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2, 7.5], "prerequisite": "Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCs in HY or 28 MCs in SC or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCs in HY or 28 MCs in SC, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "PS4883A", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 40, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
