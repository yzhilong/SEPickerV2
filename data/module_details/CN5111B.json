{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Students will learn fundamentals, methods, and software for formulating and solving optimization problems related to chemical engineering. They will study various methods of linear/nonlinear and unconstrained/constrained programming, which would enable them to select and use appropriate solution algorithms and/or software for solving a given problem. Guest lecturer with extensive industrial experience in the optimization area will discuss many case studies in reality, to demonstrate how these theoretical tools can be used.", "title": "Process Optimization with Industrial Applications", "department": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "Calculus, linear algebra and numerical methods at undergraduate level", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CN5111B", "attributes": {"lab": true}, "semesterData": []}
