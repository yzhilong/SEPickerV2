{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Resolving the many environmental problems that we face is one of the key challenges facing us in the coming decades. Solutions for these problems have both technical and social aspects, involving the social awareness of the problem as well as the engineered solutions. This course is designed to introduce students to the basic science behind the problems and to the commonly used solutions to the problems.  The student is introduced first to the basics of environmental chemistry, environmental microbiology, and toxicology, and then to the application of those principles in solving air, water, and soil pollution issues. The course is designed for students in science, arts, or engineering, and compliments the Global Environmental Issues course (GEK1522).", "title": "Environmental Science and Technology", "department": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0.5, 0, 0, 6.5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GEK2502", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
