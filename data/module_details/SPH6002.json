For time-to-event data analysis involving the Cox proportional hazards model, the proportional hazards assumption will be discussed, and strategies for handling non-proportional hazards, such as via stratification or modelling using time-dependent covariates will be introduced. We also consider the situation where several competing event types define the event of interest in a time-to-event study. Methods for analysing repeated measures data, assessment of model fit, statistical handling of confounding and statistical evaluation of effect modification will also be discussed. The statistical models introduced\nwill be applied to real life clinical or public health data.", "title": "Advanced Quantitative Methods II", "department": "SSH School of Public Health Dean's Office", "faculty": "SSH School of Public Health", "workload": [2, 0, 1.5, 4.5, 3.5], "prerequisite": "1) A minimum grade \u2018B-\u2018 obtained in CO5103 Quantitative Epidemiologic Methods OR SPH5002 Public Health Research Methods, and \n\n2) SPH5006 STATA Primer for Public Health or working knowledge of STATA", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SPH6002", "attributes": {"mpes2": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 20, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 20, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
