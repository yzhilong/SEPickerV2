{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course will focus in detail on the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, governing international commercial sales in the US and abroad. The objective of this course is to give participants an overview of the (different) ways in which this Convention has been applied by judges and arbitrators throughout the world, thus giving participants the tools to draft international import/export agreements favourable to their future clients. Participants will be given hypothetical cases and will be asked to critically examine the different substantive solutions proposed by courts and arbitrators. As the convention does not deal with all the problems that may arise out of international commercial sales, the course will also deal with the issue of how to fill the gaps left by this Convention.", "title": "International & Comparative Law Of Sale", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LL6027", "semesterData": []}
