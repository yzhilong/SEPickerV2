{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The objectives of this module are to build upon the fundamentals taught in GE2215 and GE3216 through in-depth study of remote sensing technology, error analysis, calibration, and image analysis.  The module places an emphasis on class presentation of recent and relevant journal articles by the students followed by critical discussion of article content.  Various applications of remote sensing and geographic information systems are covered in greater detail than in lower level modules and are the subject of project assessments.", "title": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "department": "Geography", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 2, 3, 3, 4.5], "prerequisite": "To read and pass GE2215.
