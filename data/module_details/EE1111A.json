{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EE1111, EG1111, EE1111B", "description": "This module introduces first year electrical engineering\nstudents to what engineers do and to the engineer's thought\nprocess. This is the first of a two-part module: Engineering\nPrinciples and Practice (EPP) I and II. Real engineering\nsystems will be used to show how engineers use different\ndisciplines of engineering to make things work. Through\ngrasping engineering fundamentals, students learn how\nengineering systems work and fail (EPP I). Through\nlearning where systems get energy and how they are\ncontrolled, students learn how multi-disciplinary concepts\nare tied together (EPP II). Students will also learn basic\ndesign, experimentation and evaluation of engineering\nsystems.", "title": "Electrical Engineering Principles and Practice I", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [5, 0, 0, 0, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE1111A", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E4A-06-03", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E4A-06-03", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "02", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E4A-06-03", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "02", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E4A-06-03", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 170, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["A", "Unknown"]}], "fulfillRequirements": ["EE2026"]}
