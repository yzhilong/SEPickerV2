{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module will focus on the interaction dynamics between the human operator and the machine/system in a human-machine system. We shall begin by defining the areas of concern in human factors engineering (e.g. the human-machine interface, the displays to be perceived, and the controls to be actuated). We shall discuss also the tools and methodologies used by a human factors engineer. The latter portion of the subject will discuss issues of capabilities and limitations of the human operator.", "title": "Human Factors In Engineering And Design", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "IE5301", "attributes": {"grsu": true, "lab": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-26T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}]}
