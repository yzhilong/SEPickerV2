{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the microscopic and phenomenological theories of superconductivity. It lays the analytical foundation for the understanding a wide range of modern applications of both low- and high- temperature superconductors. The lecture links established theories with current research activities in the development of the physics and technology of the superconductors. Students should have a background in quantum mechanics and thermal physics.", "title": "Superconductivity", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 1, 5], "prerequisite": "Students who have passed either PC4214 or PC4240, or departmental approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PC5208", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["PC4214", "PC4240"]}}
