This module?s objective is to focus on evidence-based management to try and understand what drives the behaviour of groups and their members. Our job is to try and understand when, if, and how phenomena change as we place people in situations where they need to rely on others to get the job done. The module will loosely follow Tuckman?s (1965) forming, storming, norming, and performing model of group development.
