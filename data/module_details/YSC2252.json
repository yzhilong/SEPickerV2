However, some of the most interesting systems cannot be modelled using just one variable.\nThe aim of this module is to extend the knowledge of Calculus (YSC1216) to more complex systems, studying the rate of change, volumes and optimization for functions in more than one variable.\nThis module gives the needed tools to apply knowledge of advanced calculus in Physical Sciences, Life Science, Economics and Statistics.", "title": "Multivariable Calculus", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 3, 5.5], "prerequisite": "YSC1216 Calculus or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC2252", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-PgRm1", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-PgRm1", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2020-11-25T05:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 180}], "prereqTree": "YSC1216"}
