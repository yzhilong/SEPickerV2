Each team will work with a selected technology developed at NUS that has a promise to generate a large market impact. The students will learn how to actually start a high-tech company based on a particular technology. This course is NOT about how to write a business plan or create a presentation for VCs. It\u2019s about taking action - talking to customers, partners, competitors in search for the right market and the right business model that can leverage the uniqueness of a technology. It\u2019s about\nexperiencing the typical creative start-up process that is often full of uncertainty to turn a new technology into a great company.", "title": "LaunchPad: Experiential Entrepreneurship", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [6, 0, 0, 7, 7], "moduleCredit": "8", "moduleCode": "MT5910", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
