{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "GEM2503", "description": "The aim of this module is to help students understand how nature works by exploring simple computer modelling and using simulation techniques. Examples from predator-prey systems, vehicular traffic, fire-fly flash synchronisation, ant colonies, earthquakes, DLA, disease spreading, and social-economic systems are used to illustrate the emergence of complexity in self-organising systems. The module will help students appreciate how computer modelling provides an algorithmic way of thinking about the science of complex systems and the complexity of their simulation.", "title": "Thinking Science on Computer", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 0, 3, 2, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GET1012", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
