Since all linguistic skills cannot be fully developed in one semester alone, stress will be placed on the acquisition of basic structures, which will be developed and reinforced in subsequent modules. The course will be conducted in Italian via teleconference from Yale.", "title": "Directed Language Study: Beginning Italian 1", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 2.5, 6], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YIL1201I", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "su": true}, "semesterData": [], "fulfillRequirements": ["YIL1202I"]}
