{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Against the backdrop of the Cold War, the Bandung Conference of 1955 stands as a symbolic event in the history of decolonisation of Asia and Africa. We examine \u2018Bandung\u2019 as a nodal point from which a variety of postwar narratives emerged, including freedom and independence, non-alignment, Third World internationalism, connecting even the US civil rights movement with Bandung. A diverse range of materials will be explored, including popular writing, film, photographs, newsreels, newspapers, journals, official documents, as well as a field trip to the conference museum in Bandung to consider the role of public history.", "title": "The Bandung Conference of 1955", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 1, 9.5], "prerequisite": "Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
