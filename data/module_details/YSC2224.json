Topics will include covalent and ionic bonding, aromaticity and stereochemistry, addition and substitution reactions, carbonyl chemistry, molecular orbital theory, as well as Infrared and NMR spectroscopy. Taking YSC2222 Organic Chemistry Laboratory concurrently with YSC2224 is strongly recommended, so that students can put their newly acquired theoretical knowledge in practice and thus gain a much deeper understanding of the material.", "title": "Accelerated Organic Chemistry", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 4, 0, 5.5], "prerequisite": "YSC1207 General Chemistry or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC2224", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-CR3", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-CR3", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-05-05T05:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 180}], "prereqTree": "YSC1207", "fulfillRequirements": ["YSC4205", "YSC3228", "YSC2222", "YSC4219", "YSC4218"]}
