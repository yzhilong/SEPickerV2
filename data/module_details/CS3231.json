{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module examines fundamental aspects of computation that every computer scientist should know. What is a finite automaton and how does it relate to regular expressions (and searching a database)? What is a context-free language and how does it relate to parsing languages? What is the P vs. NP problem and why does it matter? How do we decide if a problem is easy or hard? This module introduces techniques for precisely formulating problems and studying their properties using a variety of commonly used reasoning techniques (e.g., model equivalence, non-determinism, digitalisation, simulation and reduction).", "title": "Theory of Computation", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "(CS1231 or equivalent) and (CS2040 or its equivalent)", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS3231", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CS1231", "CS2040"]}}
