{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The aim of this module is to introduce the state-of-the-art architectural advances underlying the current generation of computing systems. A review of pipelined processor design and hierarchical memory design is followed by advanced topics including exploitation of instruction-level parallelism through dynamic instruction scheduling and speculation, exploiting thread-level parallelism through\nmultiprocessors, and optimizations for memory and storage subsystems. Throughout the module, particular emphasis will be placed on cost-performance-power-reliability trade-offs in designing the different architectural components.", "title": "Advanced Computer Architecture", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 0, 0, 4, 4], "prerequisite": "CS3220 Computer Architecture or CS4223 Multi-core Architecture", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS5222", "attributes": {"lab": true, "mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "SR_LT19", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 110, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["CS3220", "CS4223"]}}
