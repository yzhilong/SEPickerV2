{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "CO5234 Developing health proposals using DME skills & tools", "description": "Two of the most important skills that public health practitioners need to develop are programme design and proposal writing. These two skills are inseparably linked: they are two sides of the same coin. A poorly designed project or programme will have very little chance of successfully competing for funds, while an innovative, well-conceived project will never get funded unless it gets written into a good proposal. A good programme design in a good proposal can lead to better implementation and management, and sets the stage for good monitoring and evaluation. In turn, a project executed well has better chances for re-funding and expansion by donors. This skills building design, monitoring and evaluation (DME) course is designed to introduce the potential proposal writer to the working environment that he will eventually confront repeatedly. It requires living through the process of applying good principles of programme/project design in developing a proposal.\n\nRemarks:\nIt is recommended that students have completed CO5102 Principles of Epidemiology and CO5103 Quantitative Epidemiologic Methods or SPH5002 Public Health Research Methods prior to reading this module", "title": "Developing health proposals using DME skills & tools", "department": "SSH School of Public Health Dean's Office", "faculty": "SSH School of Public Health", "workload": [10, 0, 0, 10, 20], "prerequisite": "SPH5007 Implementing Public Health Programmes and Policies", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SPH5410", "attributes": {"mpes2": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0830", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": {"start": "2021-01-04", "end": "2021-01-04"}, "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0830", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": {"start": "2021-01-06", "end": "2021-01-06"}, "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0830", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": {"start": "2021-01-08", "end": "2021-01-08"}, "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0830", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": {"start": "2021-01-07", "end": "2021-01-07"}, "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0830", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": {"start": "2021-01-05", "end": "2021-01-05"}, "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0830", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": {"start": "2021-01-09", "end": "2021-01-09"}, "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Saturday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": "SPH5007"}
