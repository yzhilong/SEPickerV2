This module covers important aspects of microelectronic processes and integration. The students will develop in-depth understanding of various unit process and of integrating the unit processes to design a  device  that  meets  electrical  performance  specification.  The  topics  covered  include  oxidation, diffusion, ion implantation Isolation, plasma etching process, thin film deposition, metal interconnects, lithography and pattern transfer technique, gate module technology, shallow junction technology, and CMOS Integration.", "title": "Microelectronic Processes and Integration", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 1, 6], "prerequisite": "[applicable to UG level students only] EE3431C or equivalent; or\n\n[Advisory applicable to GD level students only] Requires background such as EE3431C or equivalent", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE5434", "attributes": {"grsu": true, "lab": true, "mpes1": true, "mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT3", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2020-11-27T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E1-06-05", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-05-05T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["EE3431C"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["EE6436"]}
