{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The aim of the course is to give a theoretical and practical introduction into selected analytical methods for the characterization of biomaterials, tissues, biomolecules and immobilized biological molecules. The methods are focused to obtain: structural, topological (e.g. atomic force microscopy), chemical (e.g. spectrometry) and functional (e.g. surface palsmon resonance and bioassays) information for the characterization of biomolecules, biomaterials, tissues and biomodified materials.", "title": "Bio-Analytical Methods In Bioengineering", "department": "Biomedical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 1, 1, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "(CM1121 or CM1501) and (LSM1101 or LSM1401)", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BN3402", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"and": [{"or": ["CM1121", "CM1501"]}, {"or": ["LSM1101", "LSM1401"]}]}}
