Topics include: Review of statistical decision making and hypothesis testing, ANOVA with homogeneity of variance tests, concepts of blocking, RCBD, fixed and random effects models with multiple comparison procedures, factorial experiments, nonparametric methods, an introduction to bootstrapping with IE-based case studies. Students will also appreciate the importance of good planning and be able to conduct and evaluate simple experiments.", "title": "Statistics for Engineering Applications", "department": "SCALE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Cont and Lifelong Education", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 3, 3], "corequisite": "ST1131/ST2131/ST1232/TS2120/IE2120E/TIE2120", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "TIE3101", "aliases": ["IE3101E"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1900", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 75, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1900", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 75, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "fulfillRequirements": ["TIE4239", "TIE4213"]}
