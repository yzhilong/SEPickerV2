{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Soft Robotics introduces the usage of soft materials to construct and design integral parts of a robot like soft actuators and soft sensors. This module will introduce different types and genre of soft robots, mechanics of soft robots and the design, kinematics of control and applications of soft robots. The objective of this module is to introduce students to a new field of robotics that are made up of, in-part or as a whole, with soft materials and systems.", "title": "Soft Robotics", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0.5, 0.5, 2, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME4242", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT7", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT7", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
