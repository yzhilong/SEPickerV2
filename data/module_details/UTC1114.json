By engaging scholarship from various disciplines (but particularly anthropology), this course explores major themes that inform the way humans prepare food across different cultures and time periods. We will particularly concentrate on the prominent example of fish. Fieldtrips will be made to one of Singapore\u2019s fishing ports and fish farms, and students will learn to apply ethnographic methods to the Singapore context. Students will also get to cook fish based on specific themes. Vegetarians and vegans are welcome.", "title": "Junior Seminar From the Fire to the Frying Pan: Cooking and Eating in Human Culture(s)", "department": "Tembusu College", "faculty": "Residential College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 1, 6], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UTC1114", "semesterData": []}
