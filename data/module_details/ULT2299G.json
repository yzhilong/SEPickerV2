{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module examines the modern history of Southeast Asia through the reading of novels and short stories set or composed in the region. It adopts an interdisciplinary approach, with students exploring particular historical periods and topics such as race and ethnicity, gender, conflict, and work and labour. To do so, they will be introduced to different approaches in literary theory, such as New Historicism and Postcolonialism, in order to understand and interpret the historical context in which fiction is written. Ultimately, students will evaluate the advantages and difficulties of using fiction as a means to understand the past.", "title": "The Modern History of Southeast Asia through Fiction", "department": "University Scholars Programme", "faculty": "University Scholars Programme", "workload": [4, 0, 0, 3, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ULT2299G", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UTSRC-GLR", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UT-AUD3", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
