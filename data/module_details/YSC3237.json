Throughout the history of mathematics, algebraic methods have been developed to solve equations using simple, but important, properties of numbers that make meaningful calculations possible. Those properties arise in a variety of other settings, however, allowing us to make algebraic arguments in a significantly broader context. This course introduces modern algebra \u2014 specifically the mathematical objects called groups and rings \u2014 through a rigorous exploration of familiar notions, including permutations, symmetries, polynomials, and matrices, resulting in a cohesive, unifying theory with far-reaching applications throughout the natural sciences.", "title": "Introduction to Modern Algebra", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 4, 4], "prerequisite": "YSC2209 Proof or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC3237", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1430", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-ELMCL", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1430", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-ELMCL", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1430", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-ELMCL", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2020-11-26T05:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 180}], "prereqTree": "YSC2209"}
