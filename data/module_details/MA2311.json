It covers the approximation of a general function by polynomials, the defining equations of lines and planes, the method to find maximum or minimum of a function, as well as the calculation of area, volume, surface area, mass, centre of gravity. The course is for students with advanced calculus background and with interest in the applications of calculus. \n\n\n\nMajor topics: Sequences. Monotone convergence theorem. Series.
