{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This is an introductory course on the fundamental constituents of matter and their basic interactions; important concepts and principles, recent important experiments, underlying theoretical tools and calculation techniques in elementary particles physics will be expounded. The topics covered are: basic properties of elementary particles and the standard model, relativistic kinematics; symmetries: isospin and SU(3), quark model;  parity and CP violation; Feynman diagrams and rules; quantum electrodynamics; cross sections and lifetimes: deep inelastic scattering; and introductory gauge theories and unified models. This module is mainly targeted at physics majors.", "title": "Particle Physics", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 1, 5], "prerequisite": "Students who have passed PC3130 and PC3232", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PC4245", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT33", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT33", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-05-05T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["PC3130", "PC3232"]}}
