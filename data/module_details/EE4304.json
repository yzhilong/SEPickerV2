{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EE3304.", "description": "This module provides students with system theory, analysis tools and design methods in discrete-time domain. It is the first course in control and automation that systematically introduces the basic concepts and principles in sampling, Z-transform, zero-order-hold, discrete equivalence and the relations to discrete-time control design. It further examines the design issues for digital PID, PID auto-tuning, phase compensator, and the model predictive control, including the performance criteria, pole-placement, as well as numerous illustrative application examples.", "title": "Digital Control Systems", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 1, 0.5, 1.5, 5], "prerequisite": "EE2010\nEE3331C", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE4304", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["EE2010", "EE3331C"]}}
