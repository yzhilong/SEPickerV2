{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "In the last decade significant advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular and cellular control of immune responses. These discoveries are now being translated into the design and testing of immunotherapeutic interventions for a range of diseases including cancer, autoimmunity, respiratory and infectious diseases. This module is for graduate students who wish to extend their knowledge and skills in both immunology and its translation to immunotherapeutics. The module aims to allow the students to understand the research process, from the fundamental discoveries at the forefront of immunological research, to the application of novel interventional immune-based therapies.", "title": "Clinical immunology and Immunotherapeutics", "department": "NUS Medicine Dean's Office", "faculty": "Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MDG5207", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}]}
