They will discuss questions such as: What makes a region? Who makes a region? How has the experience of colonialism shaped the region? What are the models of regional cooperation and integration, and whose models are they? How do regions \u2018interact\u2019 with postcolonial global structures and dynamics? Students are encouraged to compare different regional experiences, and draw from this breadth of knowledge to critically evaluate the concepts and theories they will learn.", "title": "The Region in the Postcolonial World", "department": "Political Science", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 2, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PS2251", "attributes": {"mpes2": true, "su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "D1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "E1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 28, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 75, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "D2", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
