When reason becomes so powerful that it dominates nature, what ethical problems will arise? Is reason or religious faith more suitable in providing a foundation for multiculturalism? These three questions, which are still much debated today, actually arose in the Age of Enlightenment, an 18th century\nintellectual movement so important that it shaped the modern West, and even, arguably, the East. We will examine representative Enlightenment treatises on these questions, and reflect on how beliefs and principles involved are still operative in our age.", "title": "Reason, Secularization & Multiculturalism", "department": "University Scholars Programme", "faculty": "University Scholars Programme", "workload": "0-0-4-0-3-3", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "USP3510", "semesterData": []}
