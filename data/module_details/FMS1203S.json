Some of the topics covered include the following:\n\n1. Is probability intuitive? A class exercise will be conducted where students\nare asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses\nand are asked to develop tests to detect the difference.\n\n2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments\n(for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a\nmedical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time\nconversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test\nwhether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first\nor last to a cup of tea.\n\n3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ\ntesting?\n\n4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific\nmodels are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such\nmodels predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on\nthe other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different\npossible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding\nembedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical\napproaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying\nuncertainty important?\n\n5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random\nrules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren\u2019t easily done by\nother means?\n\n6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in\nwhich massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being\nsearched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market\nresearch for example)?", "title": "FS: Randomness in Scientific Thinking", "department": "Statistics and Applied Probability", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 0, 4, 4, 0], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "FMS1203S", "semesterData": []}
