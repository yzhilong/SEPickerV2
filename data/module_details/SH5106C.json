{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course will review the physics on ionising and non-ionising radiation applicable to the use of the radiation sources in an occupational environment. Types of radiation sources used in the industry, e.g., X-rays, radioactive sources, microwaves, UV, IR and lasers will be studied. The potential adverse health effects, exposure monitoring, engineering controls and personnel controls will be reviewed.", "title": "Radiation", "department": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SH5106C", "semesterData": []}
