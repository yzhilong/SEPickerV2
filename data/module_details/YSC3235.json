{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The aim of this course is to examine animal behavior from a biological, and especially an evolutionary, point of view. We will explore the causes and consequences of animal behaviors, including topics such as: optimality and foraging; predation and risk; territoriality and aggression; mating competition; parent-offspring and sibling conflict; personality and behavioural syndromes; living in groups; altruism, mutualism, and eusociality. We will also address some questions of the evolution of cognition in animals. Students will discuss the primary literature, conduct small group and independent projects on animals, and write individual review papers.", "title": "Animal Behaviour", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 3, 2, 4.5], "prerequisite": "YCC1122 Quantitative Reasoning and YCC1131 Scientific Inquiry 1 or with the permission of the instructor.", "corequisite": "YSS2201 Introduction to Psychology or YSC2216 Evolutionary Biology or YSC2231 Foundations of Neuroscience or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC3235", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-ELMCL", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-ELMCL", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-04-27T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 180}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["YCC1122", "YCC1131"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["YSC2240"]}
