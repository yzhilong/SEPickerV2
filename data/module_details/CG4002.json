It is structured to contain substantial design and development of hardware and software components.\nThis module is the culminating point of a series of modules integrating the theories which students have already learnt in CS1010, CS2040C, CG2028, CG2271 and CS2113/T. With this capstone project, students would be able to better appreciate the relevance of the various components in the Computer Engineering curriculum to large scale computer engineering projects.", "title": "Computer Engineering Capstone Project", "department": "Computing and Engineering Programme", "faculty": "Multi Disciplinary Programme", "workload": [1, 0, 3, 14, 2], "prerequisite": "CG2028 Computer Organization and CG2271 Real-Time Operating Systems and CS2113/T Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming", "moduleCredit": "8", "moduleCode": "CG4002", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "02", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "COM1-0206", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "02A", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "COM1-0210", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01A", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "COM1-0210", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "COM1-0206", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "02", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "COM1-0206", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "COM1-0206", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CG2028", "CG2271", {"or": ["CS2113", "CS2113T"]}]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["CS5476", "CS4276"]}
