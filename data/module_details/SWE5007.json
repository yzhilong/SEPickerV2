{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The Capstone project for the Master of Technology in Software Engineering is designed to allow students to experience engineering smart, secure and scalable\nsoftware systems, platforms and products.\n\nThe project allows students to apply their knowledge in a real world context, demonstrating their mastery of a range of software skills, such as in project management, requirements analysis, architecture and design, software construction, verification and validation. It also allows students to apply techniques and skills learnt to build smart systems and platforms that are capable of handling and making use of AI techniques, Internet of Things and Big Data.\n\nThe capstone project will be conducted typically in teams of 3-5 students. However in special cases, students maybe allowed do individual projects.\n\nStudents are expected to spend at least 40 man-days of effort each.", "title": "Capstone Project in Software Engineering", "department": "Institute of Systems Science", "faculty": "Institute of Systems Science", "workload": [0, 0, 0, 15, 0], "prerequisite": "Before commencing the Capstone Project, the students must successfully complete three out of the following certificates:\n1.
