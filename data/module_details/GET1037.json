{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module discusses \u2018big picture\u2019 History by considering defined themes that range across time and space. The focus is not on individual societies or\ntime periods, but on questions related to commonalities in developments across all societies. This approach is like looking at a painting from a\ndistance instead of at the brush strokes that constitute it, and will lead to questions about what human activities and experiences constitute the global\nexperience. As part of the Thinking and Expression pillar, this module will help students think historically and also critically engage the maxim that \u2018the past is a foreign country.\u2019", "title": "Big Picture History", "department": "History", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 1, 6], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GET1037", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
