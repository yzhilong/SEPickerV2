This module supports the implementation of the capstone project through the development of self-regulated research excellence. Arts and Humanities students will pursue their research, construct creative works, and consider methodological issues together to critique and improve each other's written work in a seminar setting. Over the 13 weeks, students will fine-tune research skills as well as oral and written communication skills collaboratively. Experts from The Writers\u2019 Centre, the Library, Arts Spaces and CIPE will also enhance the module.", "title": "Arts and Humanities Capstone Project", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 2, 0, 5, 5.5], "prerequisite": "All Year 1 and 2 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "10", "moduleCode": "YHU4104", "attributes": {"fyp": true, "year": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "TP-GLR", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-KChanrai", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
