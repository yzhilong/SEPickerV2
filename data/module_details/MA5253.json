{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course will be an introduction to Riemann surfaces, focusing on topics such as topology of Riemann surfaces, divisors and line bundles, differential forms and Hodge theory, the Riemann-Roch theorem, period mappings, the Poincar\u00e9-Koebe uniformisation theorem. We will also discuss more advanced topics such as algebraic curves, hyperbolic geometry and discrete groups of automorphisms.", "title": "Riemann Surfaces", "department": "Mathematics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "MA4247 or departmental approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MA5253", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "MA4247"}
