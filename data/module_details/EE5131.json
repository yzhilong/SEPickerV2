{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EE6131 Wireless Communications (Advanced)", "description": "This course covers various basic topics in wireless communications for voice, data, and multimedia. It begins with an overview of current wireless systems and\nstandards, followed by a characterization of the wireless channel, including path loss, shadowing, and the flat vs. frequency-selective properties of multipath fading. It then examines the fundamental capacity limits of wireless channels and the characteristics of the capacity-achieving transmission strategies. This part is followed by practical digital modulation techniques and their performance\nunder wireless channel impairments, including diversity techniques to compensate for flat-fading, multicarrier modulation to combat frequency-selective\nfading, and an introduction to multi-antenna communications. The course concludes with a discussion of various practical multiple access schemes in wireless cellular systems.", "title": "Wireless Communications", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 2, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE5131", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
