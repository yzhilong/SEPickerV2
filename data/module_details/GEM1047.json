{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "GEH1016", "description": "Consumption has come to dominate our lives, is driving economies, yet also endangering the future of our planet. This module asks questions about consumption\nfrom multiple perspectives, such as how did consumption assume its prominent place, how do economists rationalise consumption, how do companies use behavioural models to craft marketing strategies, whether consumption is good or bad for society or the individual, or whether consumers need to be protected. Participants in this module will explore how different disciplines approach such questions and\nwill have the opportunity to reflect on their own consumption practices and impact on the social and physical environment.", "title": "Understanding Consumption", "department": "Japanese Studies", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GEM1047", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
