The key\nunderlying human thought process is often represented by the term  \u2018computational thinking\u2019 but this thought process is much more than thinking like a programmer or computer-like. It is a broadly interdisciplinary process\nencompassing both the arts and the sciences, and essential for succeeding in an interconnected and data driven world.
