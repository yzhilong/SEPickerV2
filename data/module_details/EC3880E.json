{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Society has oriented itself within cities  for more  than 10  millennia.  Cities  enable  trade,  self\u2010protection and social expression. They also create the need for politics, \nlaw and administration. This module  investigates  the phenomenon of cities. We discuss  reasons why cities form,  drawing  on  the  example  of  both  ancient  and \nmodern  cities.  Then,  we  discuss  the  success  and failures  of  cities  at  fulfilling  the  purposes  of  their formation, and explore the reasons for the success of some cities and the failure of others. What makes a city great?  Why  do  cities  fall?  How  should  cities  be managed to achieve \u201cgreatness\u201d?", "title": "Topics  in  Economics:  The  Rise  and  Fall  of Great Cities", "department": "Economics", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [4, 0, 0, 3, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EC3880E", "semesterData": []}
