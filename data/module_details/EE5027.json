PR deals\nwith automated classification, identification, and/or\ncharacterisations of signals/data from various sources.\nBecause real world data is noisy and uncertain, we will\nfocus on SPR techniques, with particular emphasis on the\ntheoretical foundations of various techniques. Topics\ncovered include: fundamentals of parameter estimation\n(maximum likelihood, maximum-a-posteriori, posterior\npredictive), supervised learning, generative models, naive\nBayes, discriminative models, logistic regression, nonparametric\ntechniques, Bayesian decision theory.", "title": "Statistical Pattern Recognition", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 2, 5], "prerequisite": "This course assumes students have taken an undergraduate probability/statistics course, an undergraduate programming course and have at least a basic linear algebra background, all of which should be covered in a typical electrical engineering or computer science undergraduate program.", "moduleCredit": "2", "moduleCode": "EE5027", "attributes": {"lab": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 37, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1700", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": {"start": "2020-09-24", "end": "2020-09-24"}, "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 37, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
