{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "There are no precluded modules.", "description": "This module deals with quantum measurement theory and the interpretation of the observed statistics. It covers advanced mathematical formalism of quantum measurement; Bell\u2019s inequalities; and the quantum-to- classical transition (notably decoherence). Emphasis is put on providing both the understanding of the concepts and the ability of using the mathematical tools.", "title": "Quantum measurements and statistics", "department": "Center for Quantum Technologies", "faculty": "NUS Graduate School", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "PC2130 Quantum mechanics 1\nPC3130 Quantum mechanics 2", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "QT5101", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["PC2130", "PC3130"]}}
