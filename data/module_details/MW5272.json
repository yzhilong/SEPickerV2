{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course will provide a detailed exploration of the role of science dialogue in relation to contemporary science debates and science and technology governance. As well as providing a theoretical understanding informed by\nScience and Technology Studies, this course will provide you with the skills to plan, design and run science dialogue. It will also give you opportunities to learn and practice skills needed to participate in and facilitate dialogue. Assessment items will require students to plan and conduct a mini-dialogue.\n\nScience dialogue refers to communication about science that brings all parties to greater understanding. The key feature is that science dialogue is bi-directional - information and insights are gained on both 'sides'. In the\ncase of dialogue between scientists or science communicators and members of the public, then, the public participants learn about the science and the\nscientists' aims and aspirations, and the scientists learn something from the public, about their concerns and aspirations and generally about the social context of the science, which informs their thinking, and potentially their\ndecisions, about that science. Dialogue has a special place within science communication as a communication medium with particular aims that is increasingly being promoted as a best practice approach within government\nand community sectors.", "title": "Science Dialogue Theory and Practice", "department": "FoS Dean's Office", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 4, 4.5], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "MW5272", "semesterData": []}
