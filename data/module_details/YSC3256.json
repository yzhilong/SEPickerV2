In this course you will consider the extent to which urbanisation has changed natural ecosystems and led to the rise of a new urban ecology, and consider how humans can value and manage this in a socio-ecological context. We will then address how the confluence of climate change, globalisation and urbanisation are fundamentally altering our living space and the implications for human health and wellness.", "title": "Urban Ecological Systems", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2, 7.5], "prerequisite": "One module in environmental studies or one module in urban studies or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC3256", "semesterData": []}
