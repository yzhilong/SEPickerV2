{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Doing performance can teach us things that watching it cannot. This module uses performance practice as a research methodology to investigate otherwise inaccessible questions of creativity, embodiment, and performance processes. The three main components of the module include: defining a research question, designing and conducting experiments/observations, presenting the outcomes. Students will conceptualize and execute their own research project, in a relationship of collaborative research with artists. The nature of the project determines the resulting presentation: multi-media talk, lecture-demonstration, or short performance or workshop. The module will also focus on case studies from a range of cultural and stylistic sources.", "title": "Performance Research", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "TS4221", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1500", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT12", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 25, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
