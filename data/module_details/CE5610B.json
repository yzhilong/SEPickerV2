{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The primary objective of this module is to equip civil engineers with sufficient knowledge and skills on the durability of concrete structures and the basic principles and concepts of repair and retrofitting. Various factors affecting durability of concrete will be dealt with including non\u2010destructive tests to assess durability. The module also emphasizes the technological and application aspects in the assessment and retrofit of concrete structures\nincluding causes of deterioration and various in\u2010situ and nondestructive\ntests. The module is targeted at practicing civil engineers and those with a keen interest in durability of concrete, assessment of concrete and retrofitting of concrete structures.", "title": "Repair and Retrofit of Concrete Structures", "department": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [1, 0, 0, 0.5, 3.5], "prerequisite": "Background in Structural Concrete Design", "moduleCredit": "2", "moduleCode": "CE5610B", "attributes": {"lab": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [11, 12, 13], "venue": "E3-06-08", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [10, 11, 12], "venue": "LT1", "day": "Saturday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "0930", "endTime": "1230", "weeks": {"start": "2020-11-21", "end": "2020-11-21"}, "venue": "LT1", "day": "Saturday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
