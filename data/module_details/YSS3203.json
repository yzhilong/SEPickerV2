{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The field of behavioral economics draws on insights from other disciplines,\nespecially psychology, to enrich our understanding of economic behaviour\nand decision making generally. Individuals frequently make decisions that\nsystematically depart from the predictions of standard economic models. In\nthis course we will attempt to understand these departures by integrating\nthe psychology of human behavior into economic analysis. This course analyzes all types of decisions made by agents on a daily basis (from which\nbreakfast to have to where to send the kids for education, etc.). Special focus\nwill be put on decision making in a context of bounded rationality.", "title": "Behavioral Economics", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 5, 4.5], "prerequisite": "YSS2203 Intermediate Microeconomics or with the permission of the instructor.", "corequisite": "YSS2203 Intermediate Microeconomics or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS3203", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1930", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-BlackBox", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1930", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-BlackBox", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-05-03T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 180}], "prereqTree": "YSS2203"}
