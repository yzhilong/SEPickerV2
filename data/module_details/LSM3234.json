{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Growth and form are fundamental to all living organisms, crucial to health and diseases. Development in imaging methods and tools has transformed biological and biomedical sciences. This module will introduce basic concepts in imaging and their applications. The major topics will include: basic optics, light and electron microscopy, fluorescence and related methods. Introduction of each imaging technology will be linked with a set of biological problems of fundamental interests and biomedical implications.", "title": "Biological Imaging of Growth and Form", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 1, 1, 2, 4], "prerequisite": "LSM2233", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LSM3234", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "S1A-03LAB2", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 48, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "S1A-03LAB2", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 48, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 48, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 48, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["A", "Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": "LSM2233"}
