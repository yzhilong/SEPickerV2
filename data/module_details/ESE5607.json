{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course covers the recent applications of environmentally friendly catalysis for pollutant detoxification, such as indoor air pollutant degradation, water pollutant degradation and self cleaning surfaces. The course also covers examples of catalytical reactions in industry that are environmentally sustainable and produce the least amount of toxic by-products or processes that use advanced, novel processes to reduce unwanted products. The course will briefly review catalysis principles, then follows up by discussing the industrial limitations of using catalysts, slurry systems vs. catalyst immobilisation, catalyst deactivation and their minimisation, mass transfer limitations, water vs. solvent based catalysts, etc.", "title": "Green Catalysis", "department": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 0, 6], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ESE5607", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
