{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module teaches translational aspects of human cancer research. It will demonstrate how knowledge of the molecular and cellular basis of cancer can be applied for the improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment of this\ndisease. Topics that will be covered include cancer epidemiology (including genetic epidemiology), histopathology, familial cancers, biomarkers for early\ndetection, prognostic biomarkers, predictive biomarkers, techniques in molecular pathology, drug discovery, targeted cancer treatments and pharmacogenetics.\nThroughout the module, particular emphasis will be placed on translating research in the field of tumor biology into improved outcomes for cancer patients. This will be illustrated using examples from clinical practice.", "title": "Translational Cancer Research", "department": "NUS Medicine Dean's Office", "faculty": "Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine", "workload": [4, 0, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "CDM5101 Fundamentals of Cancer Biology", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CDM5102", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}], "prereqTree": "CDM5101"}
