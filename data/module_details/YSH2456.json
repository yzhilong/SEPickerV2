{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This short course investigates the links between international trade, natural resource use and the environment.  The lectures will address four key questions.  One, to what extent are natural resources traded, and by whom?  Two, what are the impacts of international trade on a country with weak or poor management of its natural resources? Three, is there evidence that international trade leads to severe overuse of natural resources? Four, does access to international markets make governance of natural resource industries easier or harder for governments?", "title": "International Trade, Resource Use and the Environment", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 10.5, 0, 0, 24.5], "moduleCredit": "1", "moduleCode": "YSH2456", "semesterData": []}
