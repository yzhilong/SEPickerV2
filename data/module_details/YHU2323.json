{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module explores color through creative perspectives that decolonize systems of knowledge. Topics to be explored include natural and artificial pigments, indigenous cultural knowledge and land-based artistic pedagogies. Students will create artworks with material-based approaches as well as new methods of thinking with systems of color. Critical engagement will be made with oral histories of color, the voice of soil and alternative philosophies to inform artistic research in practice. Final art projects will work with diverse sources of knowledge selected by students from the topics of the module to form creative responses of their own.", "title": "Decolonizing Color", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 3, 0, 6.5], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU2323", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": []}
