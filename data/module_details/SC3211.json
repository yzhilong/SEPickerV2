{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Science and technology shape our lives from the beginning to the end. Sociologists, being scientists themselves, observe the observations which scientists make about the world, look at the ways in which technologies change and shape that world, and try to make sense of processes which, as Weber claims, have divested the world of any meaning whatsoever. In this course, classical and contemporary approaches to the sociology of science, technology and society will be introduced, discussed and exemplified by several case studies.  This course is mounted for students throughout NUS with an interest in the influence of science and technology on society.", "title": "Science, Technology & Society", "department": "Sociology", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SC3211", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "E1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "AS4-0206", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 17, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "D2", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], "venue": "AS4-0206", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 17, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "D1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], "venue": "AS4-0206", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 16, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown", "A"]}]}
