{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "What does it mean to speak about literature of the Islamic world? Can the Islamic be a salient category for the literary? With these broad questions in mind, this class will introduce students to the diverse literary traditions of the Islamic world from the post-classical (1350-1850) to the modern period (1850-current day). Considering literary traditions such as Malay, Persian, and Urdu, we will interrogate the transformative role Arabic literary culture has played in regions where Islam is the dominant religion. Then, in the modern period, we will ask how colonialism and the nationalisms that followed changed these literary landscapes.", "title": "Literatures of the Islamic World", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU2312", "semesterData": []}
