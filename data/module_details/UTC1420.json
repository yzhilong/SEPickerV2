{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "All other UTCP Junior Seminars\nUTC11%, UTC14%, UTC17%", "description": "This interdisciplinary module introduces new understandings of migrant communities by drawing on approaches from systems thinking to sociology. While migrants are often seen merely as workers, migrant categories vary, as do the reasons for moving. Along the way, migrants form communities that reconstitute societies into robust and diverse countries. Given global-local dynamics of migration, this interdisciplinary module uses Asia to examine the types of migrants (from workers to climate refugees) as well as the causes and consequences of migration shaping the economy, security, identity, health and the environment. The class also explores how migrants communities cultivate resilience to various challenges.", "title": "Jr Sem: Beyond Borders: Migrant Community & Resilience", "department": "College of Alice and Peter Tan", "faculty": "Residential College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UTC1420", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "CAPT-SR3", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 16, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "CAPT-SR1-2", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 16, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "CAPT-SR1-2", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 16, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "CAPT-SR1-2", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 16, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
