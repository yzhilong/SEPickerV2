{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course introduces the programming methodology of Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). It first covers programming in PROLOG, the basic\n\nCLP programming language. The main part of the course covers modelling of complex problems using constraints and rules, and the use of advanced\n\nalgorithms that are supported by the constraint solvers in modern CLP systems. Also covered are the mathematical foundations of CLP. Throughout\n\nthe course, practical exercises are performed using a modern CLP system such as CLP(R) or Eclipse.", "title": "Constraint Logic Programming", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "CS2104 Programming Language Concepts.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS4216", "attributes": {"lab": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "CS2104"}
