{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EE5131", "description": "This course covers various basic and selected advanced topics in wireless communication. It begins with an overview of current wireless systems and standards, followed by a mathematical characterization of the wireless channel. It then examines the fundamental capacity limits of wireless channels and the\ncharacteristics of the capacity-achieving transmission strategies. This part is followed by practical digital modulation techniques and their performance under wireless channel impairments, including diversity techniques to compensate for flat-fading, multicarrier modulation to combat frequency-selective fading, and multiple antenna space-time communications. The course concludes with a discussion of various practical multiple access schemes in wireless cellular systems.", "title": "Wireless Communications (Advanced)", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE6131", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
