{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Depictions of \u2018natives\u2019, \u2018primitives\u2019 and \u2018savages\u2019 abound in the popular cultures of developed countries worldwide. In this module we will examine common stereotypes of native people and primitive cultures to uncover the underlying ideologies driving them, and analyze what cultural purpose such stereotypes serve in modern day life. We will seek to discern what palpable differences exist between primitive and modern people, and to confront the cultural and ethical conundrums entailed by those differences. Finally, we will explore how primitive people view modern society, and assess what the future may hold for native cultures in our fast globalizing world.", "title": "Writing & Critical Thinking: Language, Culture and 'Natives' People", "department": "University Scholars Programme", "faculty": "University Scholars Programme", "workload": "0-0-4-6", "prerequisite": "Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UWC2101V", "semesterData": []}
