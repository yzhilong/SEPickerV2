{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module is designed for graduate students in mathematics.  It covers the following major topics:  Homotopy theory: homotopy groups, fibrations, Hurewicz Theorem, Whitehead Theorem, Postnikov systems and Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, simplicial homotopy theory, simplicial groups, James construction, Hopf invariants, Whitehead products, Hilton-Milnor Theorem, cohomology operations and the Steenrod algebra.  Homology theory: homology of fibre spaces and Leray-Serre spectral sequences.  Geometry: homotopy and homology of Lie groups and Grassmann manifolds, fibre bundles.", "title": "Homotopy Theory", "department": "Mathematics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 2, 5], "prerequisite": "MA5236 or departmental approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MA6217", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "MA5236"}
