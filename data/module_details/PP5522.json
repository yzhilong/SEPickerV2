{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Appeals to the rule of law are ubiquitous in academia and politics. There is little agreement, however, about the ideals and practices entailed by a commitment to the rule of law. This course explores the rule of law from theoretical and applied perspectives. It begins by examining the different conceptions of the rule of law espoused by philosophers. Attention then turns to how the rule of law is invoked in legal and political debates over the administrative state, the war on terror, and the international order. Specific legal systems, like those of China and the United States, are also discussed.", "title": "The Rule of Law", "department": "LKYSPP Dean's Office", "faculty": "LKY School of Public Policy", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PP5522", "semesterData": []}
