It\nexplains how law has a role to play in recognising and\nenforcing concepts of monetary value in private\ntransactions. It considers the distinctive ways that property\nlaw applies to money, including the role of property law in\ncontrolling the consequences of failed or wrongly-procured\npayment transactions. The module considers the capacity\nof private law to respond to the special problems of\nmonetary transactions involving a foreign currency system,\nand the legal challenges posed by new monetary\ndevelopments such as cyber-currencies.", "title": "Monetary Law", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.\nLaw of Contract; Principles of Property Law; Equity and Trusts", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LL5348", "semesterData": []}
