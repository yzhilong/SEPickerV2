{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "BH3301 or BZ3501 or BK3309M or PS3243", "description": "This course deals with the study of human behavior in organisations: how people influence organisational events and how events within the organisation influence people's behaviour.  Organisational behavior is a field that draws ideas from psychology, social psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, and management and applies them to the organisation.  The field of organisational behaviour covers a wide range of topics: organisational culture, motivation, decision making, communication, work stress and so on.  In the end, the field of organisational behavior asks two questions: (1) why do people behave as they do within organisations? (2) how can we use this information to improve the effectiveness of the organisation?", "title": "Organisational Behaviour", "department": "Management and Organisation", "faculty": "NUS Business School", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 4, 3], "prerequisite": "MNO1001 or BH1001 or BZ1001 or BK2002 or HR2001 or HR2101 or HR3111 or HR3308", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MNO3301", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "A1", "startTime": "0830", "endTime": "1130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "BIZ1-0204", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 5, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "A2", "startTime": "0830", "endTime": "1130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "BIZ1-0201", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 5, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "A2", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "BIZ1-0304", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "A1", "startTime": "0830", "endTime": "1130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "BIZ1-0304", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["MNO1001", "BH1001", "BZ1001", "BK2002", "HR2001", "HR2101", "HR3111", "HR3308"]}}
