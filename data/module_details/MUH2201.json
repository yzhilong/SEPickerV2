{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Today\u2019s most widely-known, international concert repertoire is primarily made up of 18th-, 19th-, and early 20th-century European and North American composers and their music. This module presents a look, listen, and study of their music and legacy focusing on two parallel movements in the European tradition: the classical, rococo, galante, emfindsamer stil, and neo-classical; and sturm und drang, romantic, and neo-romantic. The focus of learning in this course is through primary source materials. (Non-conservatory students that can read music are invited to enrol in this course as free elective.)", "title": "Classical Styles and Romantic Spirits", "department": "YSTCM Dean's Office", "faculty": "YST Conservatory of Music", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 4, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MUH2201", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1100", "endTime": "1230", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "YSTCM-SR1", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1100", "endTime": "1230", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "YSTCM-SR1", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1230", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "YSTCM-SR1", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1230", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "YSTCM-SR1", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Sectional Teaching", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
