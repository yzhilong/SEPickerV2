{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "CS4230", "description": "The aim of this module is to study the various measures of difficulty of problem solving in computing, and to introduce some techniques in theoretical computer science such as non-determinism, digitalisation, simulation, padding, reduction, randomisation and interaction. Topics covered include: space and time complexity - the classes P, NP, co-NP, PSPACE, EXP, etc.; tape compression; linear speedup; polynomial reduction; Cook's theorem; Savitch's theorem; translation lemma; Gap theorem; NP-completeness and NP-hard problems; probabilistic complexity classes; approximation algorithms; and interactive protocols.", "title": "Computational Complexity", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "CS4232 Theory of Computation", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS5230", "attributes": {"lab": true, "mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "CS4232"}
