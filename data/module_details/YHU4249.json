Authors might include Goethe, Austen, Stendhal, Balzac, Bront\u00eb, Freytag, Fontane, and Schreiner, as well as 20th-century examplars like Joyce, Woolf, and Dangarembga, and key theorists of the genre.", "title": "The Self and Society: The Novel of Development", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 1, 8.5], "prerequisite": "YHU3210% Proseminar in Literary Studies or with the permission of the\ninstructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU4249", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "YHU3210"}
