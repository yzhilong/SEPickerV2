{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "LSM3217 Human Ageing and LSM4217 Functional Ageing", "description": "This course will be a deep-dive into the topic of ageing. As the course is designed as a science course within the life-science major, the predominant perspective will be biological and biomedical. We will cover biological ageing and its medical consequences, mechanisms of ageing, including current and past theories on molecular causes of ageing, evolutionary theories of ageing and recent therapeutic developments.  However, we will also explore historic perspectives, e.g. how current attitudes and strategies are related to the history of medicine. Finally, we will consider social, socio-economic and public health questions related to populating ageing.", "title": "The Biology of Ageing", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "YSC2202 Biology Laboratory or any two Life Sciences modules or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC3255", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-CR3", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-CR3", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": "YSC2202"}
