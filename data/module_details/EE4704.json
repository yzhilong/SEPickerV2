This course will provide students with a good foundation in computer vision and image processing, which is important for those intending to proceed to biomedical engineering, intelligent systems and multimedia signal processing. The following topics are taught:  elements of a vision system, image acquisition, 2-D discrete Fourier transform, image enhancement techniques, theoretical basis and techniques for image compression, segmentation methods including edge detection, feature extraction including texture measurement, and object recognition.", "title": "Image Processing and Analysis", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2.5, 1, 0.5, 1, 5], "prerequisite": "EE2023/CG2023", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE4704", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT2", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Packaged Lecture", "size": 100, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT2", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Packaged Tutorial", "size": 100, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2020-11-28T05:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["EE2023", "CG2023"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["EE5731", "EE4309"]}
