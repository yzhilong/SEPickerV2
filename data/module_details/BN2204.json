{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EG1109/EG1109M Statics and Mechanics of Materials", "description": "The module introduces students to the fundamentals of solid and fluid mechanics. In solid mechanics, students will apply engineering statics and dynamics to analyse the musculoskeletal system, understand kinematics and kinetics of human motion, and apply mechanics principles in deformable bodies, i.e., stress, strain, shear, bending and torsion. In fluid mechanics, students will learn fundamental transport solutions that model major features of biological flow, including the application of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy to blood flow in the cardiovascular system, basic knowledge of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics, basic mass transfer, bifurcation flow and hemorheology in macrocirculation and microcirculation.", "title": "Fundamentals of Biomechanics", "department": "Biomedical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 1, 0.5, 3, 3.5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BN2204", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "W3", "startTime": "1500", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "EA-02-11", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 61, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT6", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 160, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "W2", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "EA-02-11", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 60, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "W1", "startTime": "1700", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "EA-02-11", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 60, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-04-26T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "fulfillRequirements": ["BN4201", "BN3202"]}
