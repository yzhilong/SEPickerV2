{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Economies succeed not just from generating ever improved domestic social outcomes, but also by navigating successfully their foreign relations. Nation states commit a dangerous error if they situate injudiciously in world order, not least with the current model of global power relations under ongoing stress. Against a background of conventional approaches, this module provides an economic perspective on rethinking world order. It asks what a rational world order is and investigates the role of smaller states in it. The course compares current reality to a rational world order, and analyzes how critical elements of such a new order might emerge.", "title": "Asia's Ascent: The Economics of World Order", "department": "LKYSPP Dean's Office", "faculty": "LKY School of Public Policy", "workload": [1, 2, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PP5182", "semesterData": []}
