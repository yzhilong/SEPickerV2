{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The electric guitar is an instrument that combines the classical techniques of generations of instrument makers with modern technologies such as integrated circuits and transistors. This course aims to introduce students to fundamental concepts in physics by understanding how an electric guitar works from how the strings are plucked through to the generation of sound effects. Students will learn elements of classical mechanics, electromagnetism and electronics by studying string vibrations, guitar pickups and amplification. These concepts will be demonstrated through introductory seminars and hands on experimentation with electric guitars.", "title": "Physics of the Electric Guitar", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": "0-0.5-1-3.5", "moduleCredit": "2.5", "moduleCode": "YSC1221", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-PhysLab", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-PhysLab", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
