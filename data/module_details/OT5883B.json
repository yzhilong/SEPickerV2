{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module will cover the fundamental of petroleum reservoir engineering which is a foundational subject for petroleum engineering. Topics cover will include primary and secondary recovery and decline curve analysis of conventional reservoirs. Students will learn to use the state-of-the-art petroleum softwares on material balance and reservoir simulation. In addition, the module will highlight the reservoir engineering aspects of unconventional reservoirs.", "title": "Topics in Petroleum Engineering: Petroleum Reservoir", "department": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "OT5883B", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
