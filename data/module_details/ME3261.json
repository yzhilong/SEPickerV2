{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course covers the principles of computer-aided tools: CAD and CAM, which are widely used in modern design and manufacturing industry. By introducing the mathematical background and fundamental part programming of CAD/CAM, this course provides the basics for students to understand the techniques and their industrial applications. The topics are: CAD: geometric modelling methods for curves, surfaces, and solids; CAM: part fabrication by CNC machining based on given geometric model; Basics of CNC machining; Tool path generation in CAD/CAM (Option to introduce a CAM software to generate a CNC program for the machining of a part); Verification of fabricated part by CNC measurement based on given geometric model. The module is targeted at students specializing in manufacturing engineering.", "title": "Computer-Aided Design And Manufacturing", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0.5, 0, 2.5, 4], "corequisite": "ME2162/ME3162", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME3261", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 150, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1100", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 150, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-24T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}]}
