{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This studio-based module develops fundamental skills in landscape design and marks the first of two bachelor-level core studios in landscape design. The module introduces basic design principles used by all design disciplines with primary design language dealing with space, form, and materials through sequential exercises. Besides common design principles, the course will emphasize the unique role of landscape architecture to modify, design, and manage ecosystems. The module will facilitate an in-depth understanding of patterns and characteristics in nature by having students read, observe, describe, and interpret urban landscape elements in creative conceptualizations and sophisticated drawings.", "title": "Design 1", "department": "Architecture", "faculty": "Design and Environment", "workload": [2, 2, 0, 2, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LAD1001", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UTSRC-LT51", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "fulfillRequirements": ["LAD1002"]}
