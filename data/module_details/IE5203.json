{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module teaches the necessary analytical knowledge and practical skills for improving decision-making processes in engineering and business environments. This is achieved by providing a paradigm based on normative decision theory and a set of prescriptive tools and computational techniques using state-of-the art software with which a stake holder can systematically analyze a complex and uncertain decision situation leading to clarity of action. Topics from utility theory and influence diagrams modeling to multi-attribute utility theory and analytic hierarchy process are covered.", "title": "Decision Analysis", "department": "Industrial Systems Engineering and Management", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "IE5203", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 135, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-25T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}]}
