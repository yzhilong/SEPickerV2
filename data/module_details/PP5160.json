{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "What are America\u2019s interests in Asia? How has it gone about pursuing them and with what degree of success? The course explores these questions by examining U.S. perceptions of, and responses to, challenges in Asia since 1945. We will focus on the wars fought by America in Asia, the regimes it fostered, the economic/military institutions it built, and relate these activities to America\u2019s conceptions of its interests and its role as a great power. The approach of the course will be chronological and historical, with special focus on the most fateful episodes of America\u2019s engagement with Asia.", "title": "America and Asia", "department": "LKYSPP Dean's Office", "faculty": "LKY School of Public Policy", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PP5160", "semesterData": []}
