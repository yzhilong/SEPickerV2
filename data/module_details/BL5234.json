{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Quantitative methods are increasingly used in biology. This module focuses on quantitative methods including dynamical systems, individual-based models, and general quantitative reasoning. The module also strongly emphasises critically thinking about when and why to use quantitative methods in biology. Each topic will be taught in the context of a few relevant high-impact papers. Topics include biodiversity, cell biology, population genetics, evolutionary game theory, and circadian rhythms. For each topic, we will learn key quantitative methods, have a critical discussion about how the quantitative methods were applied in the papers, and discuss the real-world implications.", "title": "Quantitative Methods and Critical Thinking in Biology", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 2, 0, 2, 4], "prerequisite": "Undergraduate background in ecology, evolution or epidemiology.
