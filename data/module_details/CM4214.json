{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module covers the commonly used methods to determine the structure of inorganic and organometallic compounds including symmetry operators, point groups and irreducible representations; Raman or IR active vibrational modes; the\nprinciples and theories of single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction techniques; assessment of quality of published crystal structures; NMR as a powerful diagnostic tool to determine structures and fluxional mechanisms. High resolution mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectroscopy may be introduced.", "title": "Structural Methods in Inorganic Chem", "department": "Chemistry", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "CM3211 or CM3212", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CM4214", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT20", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT20", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1100", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "S8-0314", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["CM3211", "CM3212"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["CM5212"]}
