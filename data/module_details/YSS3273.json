{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course is designed to give training in spatial and demographic methods relevant to urban and social studies with three major foci: (a) essential theories regarding spatial and demographic structures and dynamics of cities (e.g., models of urban form, central place theory, rank-size rule); (b) methods of spatial visualization and analysis of urban social phenomena using (GIS) software (e.g., map projections, coordinate systems, spatial data manipulation & visualization, and geodatabase management); (c) techniques to calculate, interpret, and present basic spatial and demographic changes in cities using STATA software (e.g., immigration and ethnic diversity, racial segregation, concentrated poverty, and residential sprawl).", "title": "Geospatial & Demographic Methods", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 2, 1, 4, 5.5], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS3273", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-CompLab", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
