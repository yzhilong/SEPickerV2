Topics include lists, queues, stacks, unionfind,\nbinary heaps, red-black trees, hashtables, tries, binary search,\nefficient quicksort, graph representations, depth-first and breadth-first\nsearch, topological sort, Dijkstra\u2019s, Prim\u2019s and Kruskal\u2019s, Huffman coding,\nand Knuth-Morris-Pratt. Additional topics may include:\n- Randomization (e.g. Bloom filters, Miller-Rabin, Rabin-Karp)\n- Time-space tradeoffs (e.g. range queries)\n- Parallel considerations (e.g. Map/Reduce, prefix-sum, quicksort)\n- Purely functional data structures (e.g. of red-black trees)\n- Approximation algorithms (e.g. vertex covering)\n- More sophisticated data structures and algorithms (e.g. leftist\nheaps, binomial heaps, splay trees)", "title": "Introductory Data Structures and Algorithms", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "YSC1212 Introduction to Computer Science or with the permission of the\ninstructor", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC2229", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1430", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "ERC-SR10", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "ERC-ALR", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": "YSC1212", "fulfillRequirements": ["YSC3203", "YSC3208", "YSC3248", "YSC4230", "YSC4231"]}
