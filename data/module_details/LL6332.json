Not only have judicial opinions about fair used cohered into a \u201cunified field theory\u201d of the doctrine, but awareness of its potential applications has increased dramatically among members of relevant communities.  The last development has been attributable in part to the development of community-specific Codes of Best Practices for the responsible application of fair use \u2013 an effort in which the instructor for this module has been active.
