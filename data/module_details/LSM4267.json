{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Animals rely on various sensory systems to detect environmental information; a common mode involves light detection. Many rely on visual stimuli for numerous behavioural activities; humans often fail to understand these light signals. This module will introduce: (i) the fundamentals of light detection, (ii) the instrumentation and software involved in accurate detection, quantification/characterisation of animal/plant light signals, (iii) the formulation of hypotheses in animal-animal and animal-plant visual communication from interdisciplinary sciences (e.g. behaviour, conservation, optics), and (iv) relevant industrial applications. This module will also visit some other systems beyond the visible light spectrum, for example: infrared reception and thermoreception.", "title": "Light & Vision in Animal Communication", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 1, 1, 2, 4], "prerequisite": "LSM3267 Behavioural Biology", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LSM4267", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0800", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": "LSM3267"}
