Analogy is an important factor\nin preparing, if not predicting, new concepts while an experience-based intuition\ncan sometimes be an obstacle. The objective of this seminar module is to\npresent case studies of the creative role of analogy in mathematics and of the\nground-breaking importance of \"counter-intuition\" in modern mathematics. A\nwealth of examples of both can be found in geometry, number theory, analysis,\nalgebra, logic, set theory and theoretical computer science. Students of this\nmodule are expected to source for relevant material in books, journals and the\ninternet under the guidance of the lecturer. The emphasis, however, will be on\nthe spirit of the mathematical enterprise rather than on the technical mastery.\nTo illustrate the use of analogy and intuition in problem solving, some\nelementary problems and puzzles will be posed in class for attempt and\ndiscussion.\n\nThe main prerequisite for this module is an inquiring mind open to new ideas.\n\nSeminar website address (if available):\nhttp:// http://ivle.nus.edu.sg/module/student/?CourseID=3472d372-c693-4a82-\n81a2-a049ca4a3efc&ClickFrom=Outline", "title": "FS: Analogy & Intuition in Mathematics", "department": "Mathematics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 0, 4, 4, 0], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "FMS1205M", "semesterData": []}
