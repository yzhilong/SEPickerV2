{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "In this module, basic electronic techniques related to quantum technologies are introduced at a level that allows students to analyze, design, build and modify electronics encountered in experimental work on quantum technologies. It covers basic circuit design, with a focus on techniques related to typical signal conditioning and processing tasks encountered in experiments and application engineering involving quantum systems like single photon detection and generation, atom and ion traps, laser spectroscopy, optical modulators and some radio-frequency techniques to drive atomic transitions, and electronic techniques at cryogenic temperatures.", "title": "Quantum Electronics", "department": "Center for Quantum Technologies", "faculty": "NUS Graduate School", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 4, 2], "prerequisite": "Some knowledge of optics, quantum physics and/or atomic physics and basic\nexperimental techniques (like practical lab courses) would be helpful, or any\nexposure to practical measurement problems.", "corequisite": "Possibly an experimental project in quantum technologies", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "QT5201S", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "CQT/SR0315", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 25, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "CQT/SR0315", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 25, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
