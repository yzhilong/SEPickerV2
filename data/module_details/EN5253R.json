{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module addresses issues of historical trauma and cultural memory; through a focus on how such memory is manifested in aesthetic (primarily literary) representation. The module assumes a dual approach to the study of selected texts, requiring attention to the topic of violence and memory on the one hand; and the ethics and politics of representation on the other.  Literary texts will illuminate problems of narrative agency, responsibility and testimony in the aftermath of a violent past. The conceptual framework of discussions derive from Maurice Blanchot and his influence on post-structuralism, and from contemporary uses of psychoanalysis by literary theorists.", "title": "Writing in the Aftermath", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "Must be registered as a Graduate student in the university or with the approval of the Department.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "EN5253R", "aliases": ["EN5253"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "AS1-0203", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 1, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
