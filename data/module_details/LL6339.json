{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "LL4339V/LL5339V/LL6339V Comparative Evidence in International Arbitration", "description": "This course considers the way that international adjudicators approach fact-finding and factual determinations. The course analyses essential policy questions as to the way legal systems should deal with evidence; considers comparative law perspectives; and aims to integrate these perspectives with practical consideration of the way documents and witnesses are dealt with in international arbitration.  There is no greater divergence between legal families than that pertaining to the treatment of evidence. For international adjudication to meet the needs of participants from all legal families, a proper understanding of comparative approaches and the degree of convergence, is essential to arbitrators and practitioners.", "title": "Comparative Evidence in International Arbitration", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "NUS\u00a0Compulsory\u00a0Core\u00a0Law\u00a0Curriculum\u00a0or\u00a0equivalent.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LL6339", "aliases": ["LL4339", "LL5339"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1430", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [4, 5, 6], "venue": "E-Learn_D", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 10, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [4, 5, 6], "venue": "E-Learn_D", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 10, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [4, 5, 6], "venue": "E-Learn_D", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 10, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
