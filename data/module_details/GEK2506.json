How drugs are employed today, watershed \"drug\" discoveries and their impact on society (for example contraceptives, antibiotics, vaccines, psychopharmacological agents), the issue of drug use in sports, \"social\" drugs and the \"pill for every ill\" syndrome will be discussed. Particular attention will be paid to \u201ccontroversial\u201d drug-related societal issues within each topic. For example, the role of pharmaceutical industry will be examined to determine if the tendency to  \u201cbash\u201d big Pharma is justified or if decriminalization of drug use will be a more effective means of curtailing drug abuse. One of the components in this module requires students to objectively evaluate such issues and articulate their stand in an audio-visual presentation.", "title": "Drugs and Society", "department": "Pharmacy", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 1, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GEK2506", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
