{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The objective of this module is to introduce students to robotics applied to the different medical conditions that require rehabilitation.  Conditions include neuromuscular disorders, orthopaedic disorders, traumatic injuries, amputation, and aging related frailty.  The students will learn how to apply engineering principles, such as such as biomechanics and mechatronics, to design and develop devices and technologies for rehabilitation. The module will also enable the students to understand the latest technologies that will have impact on the field of rehabilitation.", "title": "Robotics in Rehabilitation", "department": "Biomedical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 2, 1, 1, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BN4203", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1500", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "EA-02-11", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 90, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-05-03T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}]}
