{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Narration \u2013 from life and fiction, of ourselves and others \u2013 pervades our lives. Drawing on the vast story tradition of Indian Buddhism, this course asks how the stories we tell construct an ethos and create individual moral characters. Are the stories I tell of my life part of creating my moral identity and the intelligibility of the world around me or are they just a nervous tick some people have, or even something we would be better without? How do different styles of narration construct different moral worlds and possibilities? Can engaging with literary narratives make us better people?", "title": "Narrative Ethics: Stories and Self-Improvement", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 and YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU2316", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-ELMCL", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-ELMCL", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["YCC1113", "YCC1114"]}}
