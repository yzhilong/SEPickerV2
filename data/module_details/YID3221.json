{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Sharks are keystone species, unfortunately global demand for shark products fuel a >US$1 billion industry that has caused dramatic declines in shark populations. A major obstacle preventing successful regulation of the shark fin trade and shark conservation is the mislabelling and/or misidentification of dried products or carcasses that have had fins removed. We will use DNA barcoding techniques to identify the sharks traded in Singapore. Previous molecular experience is not required. With the data generated we will produce a scientific paper for publication.", "title": "Wildlife Forensics and the Shark Fin Trade", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 0, 3, 2.5, 7], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YID3221", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-YESLab", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
