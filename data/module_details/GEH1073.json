{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module introduces the aesthetics, forms and genres, major themes, representative poets and evolution of Chinese poetry over a span of 3,000 years. It examines the historical background, rationales and linguistic concerns behind the poetic forms, rules and regulations. It reviews how Chinese poets applied metaphors, allusions and imagery to convey their sophisticated feelings, how they considered the relationship between state, society, nature, arts and themselves. It also studies how modern poets, including those from Singapore and North America, used traditional (as well as vernacular) forms to voice their opinions about contemporary socio-political issues.", "title": "The Art of Chinese Poetry: Past and Present", "department": "Chinese Studies", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 2, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GEH1073", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "E2", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 75, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "E1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
