Major topics: Motion in a central force field and Kepler's three laws of planetary motion, D'Alembert's principle of virtual work, Lagrange's equations of motion, Legendre transformations and Hamilton's equations of motion, geodesics description of inertial motion, Euler's equation for rigid body motion, Noether's theorem, canonical transformations, and the Hamilton-Jacobi equations.", "title": "Theoretical Mechanics", "department": "Mathematics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "MA2108 or MA2108S or MA2212 or PC2212", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MA4248", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["MA2108", "MA2108S", "MA2212", "PC2212"]}}
