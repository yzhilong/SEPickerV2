{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Students will learn the fundamentals, methods and software for formulating and solving optimization problems of relevance to chemical engineering. They will study various methods of linear/nonlinear and unconstrained/constrained programming, which would enable them to select and use appropriate solution algorithm and/or software for solving a given problem. They will also execute the various steps in optimization and demonstrate their acquired knowledge by solving a sufficiently complex practical problem of their own choice in a term project. This is for graduate students who wish to learn optimization", "title": "Optimization of Chemical Processes", "department": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CN5111", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E1-06-08", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
