{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Singapore is a highly urbanized small tropical island country with reduced pristine lowland rainforests and marine intertidal habitats. In comparison, sub-tropical Taiwan is larger and has numerous unspoilt habitat types. Using a variety of field techniques, students will learn about organismal ecology and biodiversity, from intertidal marine habitats (Singapore) to lowland (Singapore) and montane (~3000m; Taiwan) tropical forests. In view of environmental and climate change (i.e. sea level rise), students will appreciate the significance of field techniques and understand the fragile nature of these habitats and their inhabitants.", "title": "Eco-Biodiversity Field Techniques in Taiwan & Singapore", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3.5, 1.3, 2.3, 10.6, 3.8], "prerequisite": "LSM2251 or LSM2252 or department approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LSM3274", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["LSM2251", "LSM2252"]}}
