{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module covers several topics in air pollution control including the nature and sources of air pollutants in the indoor and outdoor environments, air pollution models, regulations, technical methods and measures to remove/suppress the emissions of air pollutants. The physical, chemical, and physico-chemical characteristics of pollutants in the atmosphere are described. The principal industrial sources of atmospheric pollution and the technological conditions for the formation of solid and gaseous substances in emissions are defined. Technical principles, basic processes, and equipment employed to limit and eliminate particulates, volatile organic compounds, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides are discussed in detail.", "title": "Air Pollution Control Technology", "department": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 1, 6], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ESE5202", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E3-06-08", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-05-03T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}]}
