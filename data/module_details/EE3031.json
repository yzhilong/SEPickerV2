{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "TR3001 New Product Development\nEE3001 Project \nMT4003 Engineering Product Development", "description": "This is an engineering module that focuses on the conceptualization, design and development of technology oriented new products. It integrates innovation, product\nplanning, marketing, design and manufacturing functions of a company. This module gives students an opportunity to conceptualize and design a product which they will eventually prototype in another module (Innovation & Enterprise II). Thus it is designed for electrical engineering students to experience an integrated learning of innovation and enterprise pertaining to new product development\nwhere technology plays a central role. The major topics include innovation, opportunity management, identification of customers\u2019 needs, product specification, design, planning, testing, manufacturing, and commercialization. Intellectual property and its relationship with all facets of new technology product design are also covered.\n\nGuest speakers from relevant industries will be invited to present practical aspects of innovation and new product development.", "title": "Innovation & Enterprise I", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE3031", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "03", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Packaged Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Packaged Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "02", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Packaged Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "02", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UTSRC-LT52", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 55, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UT-AUD1", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 55, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "03", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UTSRC-LT53", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 55, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
