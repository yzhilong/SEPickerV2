{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module introduces the techniques and strategies in rapid response manufacturing. Topics include: an overview of rapid product development techniques and strategies; data capture and shape reconstruction techniques; various types of rapid prototyping techniques such as SLA, SLS, LOM and FDM; concept of rapid tooling; design for X and concurrent engineering; life cycle assessment methods and environmental risks in products. Topics in virtual manufacturing include: virtual factory, distributed manufacturing, virtual prototyping, and the human aspects. The module will be useful to engineers and designers who are concerned with the rapid changes in manufacturing as well as the shortening product lead-times.", "title": "Rapid Response Manufacturing", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME5609", "semesterData": []}
