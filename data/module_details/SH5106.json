{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course will review the physics on ionising and non-ionising radiation applicable to the use of the radiation sources in an occupational environment. Types of radiation sources used in the industry, e.g., X-rays, radioactive sources, microwaves, UV, IR and lasers will be studied. The potential adverse health effects, exposure monitoring, engineering controls and personnel controls will be reviewed.", "title": "Radiation", "department": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SH5106", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 44, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
