This module will examine how Tokyo copes with issues facing a modern metropolis, especially its response to the challenge of globalization. Moreover, by analyzing Tokyo's history of development, this module will discuss the extraordinary pace and intensity of urbanization as a result of globalization as well as common problems faced by \"global cities\" around the world.
