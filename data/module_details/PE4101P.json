{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Nudge policy uses people\u2019s cognitive biases to steer them towards decisions that they would have made if they were rational. This module takes an in-depth look at nudge policy, and the ethical and political issues surrounding it.\nWe first review nudge policy and the psychological theories underpinning it. We then tackle issues such as: whether governments can identify a citizen\u2019s true/rational preferences and help citizens satisfy them, whether nudges are manipulative or paternalistic, whether nudges violate principles of publicity and transparency, and what public choice analysis could tell us about nudge policy.", "title": "The Ethics and Politics of Nudging", "department": "Philosophy", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "Completed 80MCs, including 28 MCs in PH, PS, EC, PE or PE-recognised modules.
