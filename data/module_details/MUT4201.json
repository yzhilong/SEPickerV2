{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module reviews key concepts and skills commonly assessed on graduate music school theory entrance exams. These include 4-part voice leading, 18th century contrapuntal techniques, post-tonal analysis, and common forms. This module assumes students are already familiar with these skills but are in need of reviewing them before entering graduate school. It is, therefore, appropriate for fourth year conservatory students whose future plans include graduate level studies in music.", "title": "Graduate Theory Preparation", "department": "YSTCM Dean's Office", "faculty": "YST Conservatory of Music", "workload": [0, 1.5, 1.5, 4, 3], "prerequisite": "Core Compositional Engagement modules (MUT1101 Intro to MCM + 3 core elective modules).
