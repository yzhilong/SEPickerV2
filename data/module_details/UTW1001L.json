How are they used in newspapers, films, and websites to magnify credibility and persuasiveness? We will look at how images are arrayed with words in news sources to create a truth-effect. Unearthing the norms of objectivity that readers accept, we will ask how particular blogs and feeds become more credible than others.

Lastly, we will analyze how they form persuasive arguments in documentaries that question the boundary between fact and faction.", "title": "From Kodak to Instagram: How Images Tell Lies", "department": "Center for Engl Lang Comms", "faculty": "NUS", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying\nEnglish Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic\nPurposes modules.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UTW1001L", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
