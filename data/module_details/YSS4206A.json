Why are we so obsessed with what other people do, even when it does not affect us? Psychological research has focused on moral reasoning, but we will look at morality from many other angles and disciplines. This module will introduce you to the study of the origins, development, and cognitive processing of morality. The module will cover the history of moral psychology, and the shift from cognitive- developmentalist theories of reasoning-based morality to the current social intuitionist theory of intuition and emotion based morality.", "title": "Topics in Psychology: Moral Judgments", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 4, 4.5], "prerequisite": "YSS2201 Introduction of Psychology or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS4206A", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "YSS2201"}
