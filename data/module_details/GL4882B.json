{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This interdisciplinary module examines the ways in which globalisation has provoked resistance as well as resilience. Global forces are often presented as inevitably and overwhelmingly structuring local actors and processes. But globalisation remains widely resisted in various ways. By drawing on materials from global studies, history, sociology, economics and political science, the class interrogates the varied local sources of and resistance to globalisation in different issue areas, ranging from health and the environment to migration and development. It problematises key concepts related to global processes and places them in the context of crucial debates about globalisation.", "title": "Contested Globalisation: Resistance and Resilience", "department": "Political Science", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2, 7.5], "prerequisite": "Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, or 28 MCs in PS with a minimum CAP of 3.2, or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "GL4882B", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 40, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
