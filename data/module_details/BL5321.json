{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Conservation actions are costly to implement. In order to optimize the use of scarce resources, conservation teams and organisations need to constantly assess how effective their strategies and management policies have been, so that they can learn and adapt; they also need to show stakeholders that the resources are well-spent in order to maintain or increase support. This module will impart the concepts and techniques of analysing the effectiveness of conservation policies and strategies, which is especially challenging in observational studies where it may be impractical (or unethical) to have properly randomized or controlled replicates. Examples of such techniques include meta-analyses, propensity score matching, and interrupted time-series analysis. The students will have hands-on practice on applying these techniques by formulating a relevant research question on conservation effectiveness, assembling a real-world dataset to address the research question, and then analyzing the dataset concurrently while the techniques are being taught.", "title": "Quantitative Analysis of Conservation Effectiveness", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [1, 2, 0, 5, 2], "prerequisite": "LSM2253 or BL5233", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "BL5321", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["LSM2253", "BL5233"]}}
