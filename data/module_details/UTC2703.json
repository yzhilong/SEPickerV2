The complex unpredictable nature of infectious diseases has also been a source of fear and threat to humans and other life forms for several centuries. The origin, spread, prevention and control of infectious diseases involve actors including animals, birds, insects, humans, environment, society and economics. This module will explore the interconnections and interdependencies between these actors as models that involve a \u201csystem of systems\u201d. Besides helping to relate model structure to dynamic behaviour, the models will be used to design optimal vaccination and control policies.", "title": "Infectious Diseases: Dynamics, Strategies and Policies", "department": "Residential College 4", "faculty": "Residential College", "workload": [0, 2, 1, 4, 3], "prerequisite": "GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UTC2703", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "RC4-SR3", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 16, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["GEM1918", "GEM1919", "UTC1700", "UTC1701", "UTC1702"]}}
