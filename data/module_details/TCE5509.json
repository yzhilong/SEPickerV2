{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "CE5509", "description": "The primary objective of this module is to equip civil\nengineering students with sufficient design knowledge and\nskills on steel-concrete composite structures both for their\nfurther education and for their future engineering career.\nThis module provides students with fundamental\napproaches in designing structural steel-concrete\ncomponents and buildings. The students will acquire\nfundamental knowledge and skills to perform structural\ndesign for composite beams, slabs, columns, joints, multistorey\nbuildings. This enables the students to conceive a\nsafe and economical structural system. The module is\ntargeted at MSC civil engineering students and those with a\nkeen interest on structural design.", "title": "Advanced Structural Steel Design", "department": "SCALE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Cont and Lifelong Education", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "TCE3166", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "TCE5509", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "TCE3166"}
