{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This seminar will examine contemporary art in Japan from Postwar to today with a focus on artist collectives, social engagement and cooperative practices. Readings and visual materials on contemporary art including Mono-ha, Fluxus, Setouchi, Mabuni Peace Project and other movements will inform discussions on the collective possibilities and impossibilities in art. We will apply gender analysis and transnational approaches, and we will decenter modernism while engaging with the work of artists, art historians, and cultural critics.  Each student will complete a final research project in a creative or expository format on one artist collective for this module.", "title": "Art and Social Change in Postwar Japan", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2, 7.5], "prerequisite": "Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules or with permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU3353", "semesterData": []}
