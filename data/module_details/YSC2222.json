{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The structure, properties, and reactivity of carbon-based molecules will be directly observed and inferred in this laboratory-based course, which supplements YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry. Students will put their newly acquired theoretical knowledge in practice and thus gain a much deeper understanding of the material. Topics include reaction set-up and purification, IR, NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS analysis, as well as an advanced synthesis project.", "title": "Organic Chemistry Laboratory", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 0, 4, 2, 6.5], "prerequisite": "YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry or with the permission of the instructor.", "corequisite": "YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC2222", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-ChemLab", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": "YSC2224"}
