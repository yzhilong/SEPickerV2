{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EE5303R", "description": "With emphasis on fundamentals, this module develops analysis methods that are used to understand the operation and design of solid-state microwave electronic circuits commonly used in microwave systems.  Methods for simulating nonlinear microwave circuits and processing of circuit parameters will be discussed. Major topics include: Linear circuit parameter conversion. Analysis of nonlinear microwave circuits. Lossy match, lossy feedback, distributed and power amplifiers. Oscillator theory; diode and transistor oscillators. Frequency multiplication, division and synthesis.  Microwave frequency conversion, mixer analysis, single-ended and balanced mixers, diode and transistor mixers, image rejection, mixer noise.", "title": "Microwave Electronics", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2.5, 0.5, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "[applicable to UG level students only] EE4101 or EE4104 or EE4112; or\n\n[Advisory pre-req applicable to GD level students only] Requires background knowledge such as EE4101, EE4104 or EE4112 or equivalent.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE5303", "attributes": {"grsu": true, "mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 50, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-12-02T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["EE4101", "EE4104", "EE4112"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["EE6833"]}
