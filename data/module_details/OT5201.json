The wave forces on offshore structures of different sizes are then discussed, including Morison equation for small structures, and diffraction theory for large structures. Accordingly, the corresponding numerical techniques are introduced.\nThe module also covers random wave forces on offshore structures. Lastly, the dynamic response of offshore structures in waves is discussed.", "title": "Marine Statics & Dynamics", "department": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 2, 0, 0, 5], "prerequisite": "CE-4 standing or higher", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "OT5201", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
