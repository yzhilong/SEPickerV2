{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module aims to provide a conceptual understanding of several of the classical and the most advanced techniques in modern neuroscience research. The emphasis is on showing how different techniques can optimally be combined in the study of problems that arise at some levels of nervous system organization. Several fundamental aspects of neuroscience research techniques, including: (1) biochemical, (2) anatomical staining, (3) behavioural, (4) electrophysiological and (5) fluorescence and functional imaging approaches will be discussed", "title": "Techniques in Neuroscience", "department": "Integrative Science and Engineering Program", "faculty": "NUS Graduate School", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GSN6503", "semesterData": []}
