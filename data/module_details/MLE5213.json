It is intended for advanced\nMSE undergraduates and MSE postgraduates who do not\nhave previous training in this area. Topics covered in this\nmodule are magnetostatics, magnetism of electrons,\nmagnetism of localized electrons on the atom,\nferromagnetism and exchange, antiferromagnetism,\nmicromagnetism, domains and hysteresis, nanoscale\nmagnetism, selected topics of current advanced magnetic\nmaterials. The module will finish with aspects of current\nresearch on magnetic materials.", "title": "Magnetic Materials", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0.5, 0, 0, 6.5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MLE5213", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1700", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 35, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1500", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 35, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2021-04-29T05:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}]}
