{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "DSC3221, IE3110E", "description": "This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modelling techniques, random number generators, discrete event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyse and develop simulation models of given problems.", "title": "Simulation", "department": "SCALE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Cont and Lifelong Education", "workload": [3, 1, 0.5, 4, 4], "corequisite": "TIE2100/DSC3215, IE2100E", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "TIE3110", "aliases": ["IE3110E"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UTSRC-LT52", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UTSRC-LT52", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "3", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 20, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 20, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["A", "Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-28T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}]}
