They will also acquire the ability to express their views and communicate meaningfully on the same topics at greater length. In the area of grammar and vocabulary, the focus will shift more towards textlinguistic and pragmatic features. Language learning skills and strategies will include recognising and applying common sociolinguistic norms in the use of the language.", "title": "German 4", "department": "Centre for Language Studies", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [4, 0, 0, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "Passed LAG3201 or placement test.
