{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module examines the intersections between ethics (the study of what is right and wrong) and aesthetics (the study of beauty and taste) in light of two questions: (1) whether the appreciation of artworks makes us morally better persons, and (2) whether a moral defect make an artwork less beautiful. Students will study both historical and contemporary philosophical debates on these two issues, and make use of examples of representational art \u2013 i.e., artworks which depict an object, event or mental state \u2013 to explore their own positions. Examples of representational art examined include: novels, paintings, films, photographs, and museum exhibits.", "title": "Ethics and Aesthetics: The Moral Value of Representational Art", "department": "University Scholars Programme", "faculty": "University Scholars Programme", "workload": "0-0-4-0-3-3", "corequisite": "Not applicable to USP modules.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UPI2207", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
