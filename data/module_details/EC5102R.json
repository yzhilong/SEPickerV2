Three main parts of the course are growth theory, business cycle models, and the investigations of certain components in the aggregate demand. Topics under each part are wide-ranging: the Solow model, the infinite horizon model, overlapping generations model, and endogenous growth models are covered for the growth part. The business cycle models deal with real business cycles, the Lucas model, and New Keynesian models.
