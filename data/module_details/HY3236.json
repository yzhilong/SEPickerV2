The module looks at both decolonisation and nation-building as processes characterised by debate and contestation in relation to (a) social, regional and group identity and (b) political rights and power. The module will study the impact of that debate and contestation on the character, institutions and political life of the nation.", "title": "The Struggle for India, 1920-1964", "department": "South Asian Studies", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "HY3236", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "aliases": ["SN3262"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 15, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
