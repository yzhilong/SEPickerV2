While this approach may make the conduct\nof trials more efficient through multiple recruitment centres,\nissues of adequate population representation, ethnicity\ndifferences and statistical robustness are frequently\nbrought up.\nThis 4-credit module provides the principles supporting\nMRCTs and address some of the concerns related to this\napproach, building on the fundamentals of good clinical\npractices, study designs (selection of population and\ndoses) and regulatory evaluation sciences (biostatistics,\npharmacodynamics, pharmacovigilance).", "title": "Multi-Regional Clinical Trials (MRCT)", "department": "Duke-NUS Dean's Office", "faculty": "Duke-NUS Medical School", "workload": [2, 2, 0, 2, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GMS5102", "semesterData": []}
