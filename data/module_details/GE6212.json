{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module examines the complex debates on economic globalisation and assesses the contributions of human geography to these debates. In particular, we will discuss and evaluate the spatial processes and ramifications of global economic change that is associated with globalisation tendencies. We will also analyse the role of states, labour, capital, technology, and politically contested discourses of globalisation in shaping global economic change. This module will be a graduate seminar comprising student presentations and discussions. Attendance and full preparation are the basic requirements. Ph.D. candidates will be expected to cope with additional written materials, as well as added responsibility in the seminar context.", "title": "Mapping Global Economic Change", "department": "Geography", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [1.5, 1.5, 0, 2, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GE6212", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": []}
