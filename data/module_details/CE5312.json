{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The student will be introduced to open channel flows covering the conservation of mass, the momentum and energy equations. This is followed with the formulations for steady gradually varied flows with/without lateral inflows/outflows. The student is further introduced to the design of channels for steady gradually varied flows. The concept of flow controls is also covered. The development of the continuity and momentum equations for unsteady flows is introduced. Flood routing is also covered along with the concepts of the kinematic wave, the diffusive wave and the dynamic wave are covered. The concept of the characteristics and its application to the solution of the simple wave problems associated with sluice gate operations and dam break is also introduced. The students will also learn to use some state-of-the-art numerical models for prediction of flood in open channels.", "title": "Open-channel Hydraulics", "department": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 2, 0, 0, 5], "prerequisite": "CE3132 Water Resources Engineering or CE4 standing or higher", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CE5312", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "EA-06-02", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2020-12-02T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": "CE3132"}
