Students will investigate the multi-facetted images of women that appear in selected films and engage in critical debates about the messages that these images convey, as well as the extent to which they are influenced by history and culture. With an understanding of film analysis and the concept of ideology, students will examine how diverse viewpoints are expressed in key scholarly readings and contemporary articles, and develop writing skills that enunciate their own position within the debates.", "title": "Women in Film", "department": "Center for Engl Lang Comms", "faculty": "NUS", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying\nEnglish Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic\nPurposes modules.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UTW1001S", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
