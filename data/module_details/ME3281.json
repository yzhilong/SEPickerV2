{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module generates an appreciation of the interdisciplinary nature of Microsystems and their impact on technology. Secondly, it enables students to apply engineering principles that have been learnt earlier in other modules. The major topics include: An overview of the principles, fabrication and system-level design and applications of Microsystems; Properties of semiconductor; Fundamentals of dynamics and vibration; Piezoelectricity; Piezoresistivity and applications in sensors; Electrostatics and Capacitance; Electromagnetism; Thermal sensors; Biosensors; Fabrication in MEMS; The target students are those with a good grasp and have a keen interest in both mechanical and electrical engineering subjects.", "title": "Microsystems Design And Applications", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 2.5, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME3281", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
