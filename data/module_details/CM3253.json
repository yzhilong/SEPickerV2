Crystalline solids and their crystal structure will be studied. Metals, insulators and semiconductors will be distinguished using the band theory of solids. Defects occur in crystals \u2013 point, line and surface \u2013 and their effects on properties of solid materials will be explained. Factors affecting crystallization and glass formation, and different components of glasses and their uses will be discussed. Formation of different types of glasses and their applications will be highlighted.", "title": "Materials Chemistry 1", "department": "Chemistry", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [4, 1, 0, 1, 4], "prerequisite": "CM1131 and CM2111", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CM3253", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "S8-0314", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 33, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1700", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "S8-0314", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 33, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "3", "startTime": "1100", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "S8-0314", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 34, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 100, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 100, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["A", "Unknown"], "examDate": "2021-05-05T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CM1131", "CM2111"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["CM4251", "CM4253", "CM4254"]}
