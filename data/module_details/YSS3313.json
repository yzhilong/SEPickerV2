{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "China has invested in thousands of development projects that promise the host countries significant economic and geo-strategic advantages. Because of that, China has left a sizable ecological footprint across the developing world. This course explores the socio-environmental implications of China\u2019s economic presence abroad, including, but not limited to, the Belt-and-Road Initiative (BRI). Has China\u2019s \u201cgoing out\u201d strategy ushered in less environmental destruction than environmental modernisation? Should it be perceived differently to other foreign investment strategies? We explore these questions and more through various country studies, contributing to the ongoing global debate about making China\u2019s investments more environmentally sustainable.", "title": "Environmental Impacts of China\u2019s Investments", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [1, 2, 0, 3.5, 6], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS3313", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-PgRm2", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-PgRm2", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
