Students will be introduced to influential theories of ideology, such as Althusserian interpellation and Gramscian hegemony, and more recent cognitivist approaches. We will engage with analyses of Singapore by political theorists, historians, and sociologists. The suitability of various theories of ideology to Singapore will be evaluated as we practice ideological critique on Singaporean popular cultural texts chosen by the students, to develop critical thinking and writing skills.", "title": "Ideology and Popular Culture in Singapore", "department": "Center for Engl Lang Comms", "faculty": "NUS", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying\nEnglish Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic\nPurposes modules.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UTW1001T", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
