It begins with examining the concepts of probability, microstates and macrostates in understanding thermal phenomena, linking these to entropy, the Boltzmann factor, ensembles, and the partition function.\u00a0\u00a0We apply these concepts to elementary physical and chemical models such as classical and quantum gases, solids, phase transitions, chemical reactions, solute\u2010solvent interactions, polymer structure.
