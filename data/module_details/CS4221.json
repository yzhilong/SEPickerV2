{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "CS5421", "description": "This module addresses the design and performance tuning of\ndatabase applications. The syllabus focusses on relational database applications implemented with relational database management systems. Topics covered include normalisation theory (functional, multi-valued and join dependency, normal forms, decomposition and synthesis methods), entityrelationship approach and SQL tuning (performance evaluation, execution plan verification, indexing, de-normalization, code level and transactions tuning). The syllabus optionally includes selected topics in the technologies, design and performance tuning of non-relational database applications (for instance, network and hierarchical models and nested relational model for an historical perspective, as well as XML and NoSQL systems for a modern perspective).", "title": "Database Applications Design and Tuning", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "CS3223", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS4221", "attributes": {"lab": true, "mpes2": true}, "aliases": ["CS5421"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": "CS3223"}
