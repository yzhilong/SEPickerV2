{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module aims to produce chemical engineers who can contribute and increase the effectiveness of problem solving in the Chemical Process Industries. It introduces robust heuristics and a systematic approach to problem\nsolving, which combines critical and creative thinking with technical knowledge. The skill development is delivered through the presentation of various problem-solving\nstrategies and techniques, and by applying them to real case studies from a few diverse process industries.", "title": "Troubleshooting with Case Studies for Process Engineers", "department": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 2, 5], "prerequisite": "CN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN2121: Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics\nCN2125: Heat and Mass Transfer\nCN3132: Separation Processes", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CN4251", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1500", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E5-03-19", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E5-03-19", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CN2116", "CN2121", "CN2125", "CN3132"]}}
