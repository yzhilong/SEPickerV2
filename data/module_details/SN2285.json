{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module examines the centrality of food, drink and dining practices in Tamil and other South Asian cultures. The module probes a fascinating facet of South Asian gastro politics by exploring such themes as the relationship between taste and nourishment, food and gender roles, the politics of commensality, and representations of eating and drinking across various visual media. The thematically organised lectures and tutori als will incorporate perspectives from history, literature, sociology, anthropology and cultural studies. The fieldwork component will comprise a visit to Little India and a banana leaf lunch, followed by a report on the meal and overall dining experience.", "title": "What\u2019s Cooking: Food and Drink in South Asian Cultures", "department": "South Asian Studies", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 2, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SN2285", "attributes": {"mpes2": true, "su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "D2", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 20, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "D4", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 20, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "D1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 20, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "D3", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 20, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
