Drawing on a range of scholarly and activist work, this seminar explores the emergence and spread of consumerism, interrogates the various definitions and drivers of overconsumption, and considers the political and policy requirements of material sacrifice in service of environmental sustainability. The seminar features direct engagement with a number of scholars of sustainable consumption, and thus requires close reading of text, thoughtful and analytic writing, and engaged discussion.
