It stresses on good programme design and programming styles, and structured programme development using a higher-level programming language. The topics covered in this module are: Algorithm design process, Programme development/coding/debugging. Programming concepts in a high-level language including programme structure, simple data types and structured types and various control structures (sequencing, loops, conditionals, etc.). Linear data structures such as arrays and linked-lists. The utility of recursion using a variety of sorting algorithms.", "title": "Programming Methodology", "department": "SCALE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Cont and Lifelong Education", "workload": [2.5, 1, 1, 0, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "TEE2101", "attributes": {"lab": true, "su": true, "ssgf": true}, "aliases": ["TE2101"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": {"start": "2020-08-13", "end": "2020-11-19"}, "venue": "ENG-AUD", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 70, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": {"start": "2020-08-13", "end": "2020-11-19"}, "venue": "ENG-AUD", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 70, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "fulfillRequirements": ["TEE3201", "TEE4214"]}
