{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Noise is recognised as a source of annoyance since antiquity. However, its economic impact due to work lost caused by noise-induced health hazard was not realised until recently. Common remedy of using barriers is frequently not the most cost-effective way of combatingthis and an understanding of the noise-producing mechanism and changing it to a quieter process is always preferred if applicable. This course will lead the students from the basic fundamentals of acoustics through various noise-producing mechanismsand finally control measures that can be applied to different circumstances. The empahsis will be on the physical picture rather mathematical.", "title": "Engineering Acoustics", "department": "Mechanical Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ME5106", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "EA-02-11", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
