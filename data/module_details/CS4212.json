{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The objective of this module is to introduce the principal ideas behind program compilation, and discusses various techniques for program parsing, program analysis, program optimisation, and run-time organisation required for program execution. Topics covered include regular expressions, context-free grammars, lexical analysis, syntax analysis; different algorithms for parsing codes, such as top-down parsing, bottom-up parsing; translation to abstract syntax using modern parser generator technology, intermediate representation, semantics analysis, type system, un-optimised code generation, code optimisation, data-flow analysis, instruction scheduling.", "title": "Compiler Design", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "CS2104 Programming Language", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS4212", "attributes": {"lab": true, "mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1700", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT19", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1500", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT19", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 30, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": "CS2104", "fulfillRequirements": ["CS5214", "CS5218", "CS5271", "CS6202", "CS6215"]}
