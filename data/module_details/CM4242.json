{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Advanced mass spectrometric methods, and scanning probe microscopies form an important group of advanced analytical techniques widely used for research & development, and also for process/product control in advanced manufacturing industries. Microfluidics & labchip techniques, in particular, are increasingly used for biochemical assays in biomedical devices. Students will learn the principles, instrumentation and applications of these techniques, and receive in-depth training in selected advanced analytical techniques, including advanced mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).", "title": "Advanced Analytical Techniques", "department": "Chemistry", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "CM3242 or by Departmental approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CM4242", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 100, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": "CM3242", "fulfillRequirements": ["CM5241"]}
