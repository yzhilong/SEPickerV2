{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The main objective of this course is to cover advanced topics in concrete engineering that is not taught on a regular basis. Focus will be placed on special cement-based materials that are fast replacing traditional normal density, low strength concrete in the construction industry. More specifically special concretes and special processes and technology for particular types of structures are discussed. Case studies will used to illustrate construction and sustainability issues. Use of concrete composites in protective structures will also be covered. Students will also be required to undertake and complete a Group Project. Students are free to discuss and agree with the Lecturers on their choice of topic. A visit to tht eh Samwoh Eco-Green park will be organized.", "title": "Topics in Concrete Engineering: Specialized", "department": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "CE 4 and above", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CE5886", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": []}
