{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "UTS2709 or UTC27%", "description": "Energy in Singapore depends mainly on imported fossil fuels/petroleum/natural gas. Obviously, in the quest for alternatives, future energy demand and mix, some challenges/dilemmas arise naturally in Singapore context: would nuclear energy deployment be feasible? Is wind energy a viable option? would a complete switch to solar, biofuels, and waste-to-energy technologies be possible? This module offers a systems and system dynamics approach to deal with such issues and the corresponding dynamics, dilemmas and decisions that arise while addressing them. Students gain insights into the political, socio-economic and environmental aspects of these challenges through relevant case studies/models.", "title": "Energy and Singapore: Dynamics, Dilemmas and Decisions", "department": "Residential College 4", "faculty": "Residential College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 4, 3], "prerequisite": "GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UTC2718", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["GEM1918", "GEM1919", "UTC1700", "UTC1701", "UTC1702"]}}
