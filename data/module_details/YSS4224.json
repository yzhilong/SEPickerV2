{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The 20th and 21st centuries have seen an unprecedented global expansion in the number of one-party regimes. Despite not conforming to standard definitions of democracy, these regimes have proven more stable and developed faster than non-democracies with which they are often grouped. In this module, students will gain a deeper understanding of politics within such regimes from a comparative politics perspective. Topics covered include the conditions facilitating the establishment and spread of one-party regimes, how leaders manage threats originating from both inside and outside the regime, the role of elections, and the conditions in which transitions away from regimes occur.", "title": "Political Order and One-Party Rule", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 4.5, 5], "prerequisite": "YSS1206 Introduction to Comparative Politics or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS4224", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-KChanrai", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": "YSS1206"}
