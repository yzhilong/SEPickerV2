Drawing on concepts from a range of disciplines, including play theory, cultural analysis, communication, game design, game studies, film studies, and literature, students will examine the nature of games, the act of playing, and the broader social and cultural significance of games. In addition to readings of academic texts related to games, students will also be expected to play, critically analyse, and design both computer and non-computer games. Seminars will involve screenings, play sessions, student-led discussion and analysis of games and associated critical texts, and practice-based design explorations.", "title": "Game Studies", "department": "Communications and New Media", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "(Not applicable to SOC/SDE/ENG students) Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in NM, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.
