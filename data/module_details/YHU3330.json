{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "What we call \u201cHinduism\u201d is a modern, originally Western, concept that aggregates a multiplicity of traditions as a single religious tradition. However, many Indians took on this identity and shaped it as their own, and as they did, the Bhagavad-G\u012bt\u0101 played an important religious and political role in this emerging self-conception\u2014as it still does today. This course examines the way in which the G\u012bt\u0101 is implicated in the history of Hinduism as a religion, through a range of texts (letters, comics, treatises, translations) focusing on the early 20th century.", "title": "Hinduism, Nationalism, and the Bhagavad Gita in the 20th  Century", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
