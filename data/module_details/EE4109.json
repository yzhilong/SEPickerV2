{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Spread spectrum modulation is the enabling technology for many current mobile wireless communication systems and is a leading candidate for next generation communication systems. This module introduces students to spread spectrum communications, including modulation (direct-sequence and frequency hopping) and detection (single and multiuser). The topics covered also include wireless fading channels, sequence design (binary shift register sequences), sequence acquisition/tracking, cellular communications and the application of spread spectrum to Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems.", "title": "Spread Spectrum Communications", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 2, 4.5], "prerequisite": "Co-requisite: EE4102", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE4109", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "EE4102"}
