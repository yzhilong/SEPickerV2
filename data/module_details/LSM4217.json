Functional age is defined as a combination of chronological, biological and psychological ages. Molecular processes governing ageing will be covered during the first half while the second half will be on societal perception, burden of disease, healthy ageing interventions and ageless society. The ageing process will be explained based on the experimental and epidemiological studies.
