{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This is an introductory course on the formal theory of computable functions. In particular, we will describe the notion of computability and answer the question whether every function from N (the set of natural numbers) to N is computable. Major topics: Turing machines. Partial recursive functions. Recursive sets. Recursively enumerable sets.
