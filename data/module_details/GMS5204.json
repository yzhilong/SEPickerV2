{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Students will be exposed to the foundation concepts, case studies and applications, some mathematics behind data science models and algorithms. There will also be practical sessions for model development, training, validation and tests. Students will acquire new knowledge of data science techniques. The new knowledge from this course will enable predictions to be made about likely diagnoses, prognoses of health conditions and risks of adverse events. There will also be a mini-project and healthcare case studies to demonstrate the applicability of data science as a key enabler for improving the delivery of health services.", "title": "Data Science + Healthcare", "department": "Duke-NUS Dean's Office", "faculty": "Duke-NUS Medical School", "workload": [4, 2, 0, 1, 2], "prerequisite": "B.Sc", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GMS5204", "attributes": {"ssgf": true}, "semesterData": []}
