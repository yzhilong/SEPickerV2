{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module interrelates Western history and theatre practice from approximately 1800 to the present, and constitutes a continuation of the theoretical, literary, technological, and historical roots of Western theatre begun in TS2231; it serves as an overview primarily for Theatre Studies majors but is accessible to others interested. The approach for the module draws from multiple disciplines and perspectives. It stresses the relationship of historical forces, ideological movements, and theatre practice in Europe and the Americas. Seminal play texts are discussed in detail, and, as appropriate, in a background of interdisciplinary material, including intercultural, filmic and cybernetic perspectives.", "title": "History and Theory of Western Theatre 2", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 2, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "TS3231", "semesterData": []}
