{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course examines the role of emotions in liberal democratic practices and institutions and in contemporary democratic theory. The course will examine three different theoretical frameworks that have recently been used to understand the place of emotions in politics: 1) neuroscientific; 2) neo-Aristotelian; and 3) Freudian/psychoanalytic. It will focus on the different conceptions put forth by each of these frameworks and the different constellations of emotions that are analysed and/or advocated by these theories. Questions to be addressed include: Are there \u201cnegative\u201d emotions? What criteria do we use to decide whether an emotion ought to be excluded from democratic practices?", "title": "Emotions and Politics", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS3263", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1030", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1030", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": "YCC2121"}
