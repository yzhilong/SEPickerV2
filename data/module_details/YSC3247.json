{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course explores the role of genomes in inferring human history and prehistory. Through secondary texts and primary literature, we will study what is known about human origins in Africa, East Asia, Europe, India, New World, and Oceania as inferred from contemporary and ancient genomes. We will learn how to analyse genomic data; make phylogenetic inferences of historical patterns; and how to apply phylogenetic methods to cultural traits, such as inferring language trees from shared lexical cognates. Finally, we will explore how genomics impacts issues of health, sex, inequality, and identity.", "title": "The Genomics of Human History", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 4, 4.5], "prerequisite": "Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
