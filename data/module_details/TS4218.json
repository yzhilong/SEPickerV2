{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This is not a course about Postmodernism. This is a course examining the relationship between Postmodernism and Theatre, their tensions and complements.  The course will examine notions of theatricality and performativity that have come to characterise Postmodernism.  Related ideas of simulacra and rehearsal, occularism and spectatorship, self-consciousness and self-reflexivity will be debated and discussed.  Postmodernism as style, attitude and as mode will be pitched against performance aesthetics and theatre techniques to further explore the relationship between the two.  The course will also locate Singapore theatre practices in the context of a global postmodernity.", "title": "Theatre and Postmodernism", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 4, 5.5], "prerequisite": "Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "TS4218", "semesterData": []}
