{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module introduces advanced mathematical methods that are essential in many areas of theoretical physics. The topics covered are: differentiable manifolds, curved manifolds, tangent and dual spaces, calculus of differential forms, Stokes' theorem, and applications to electromagnetic theory; symmetries of manifolds, Lie derivatives, Lie groups and algebras, their representations and physical applications. The module is targeted at students who wish to study theoretical physics.", "title": "Mathematical Methods in Physics III", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 1, 5], "prerequisite": "Students who have passed PC3274", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PC4274", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2021-04-28T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": "PC3274", "fulfillRequirements": ["PC5204B"]}
