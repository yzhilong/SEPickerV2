{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course will invite study of a range of texts and visual media centred on the Trojan War: from Homer\u2019s Iliad, through Roman responses, to recent cinematic reconstructions. \n\nThrough this selective focus, students will chart the development of a legend from the Iliad, which presents an elite male world steeped in religious obligation and social protocol, to versions that offer wider social and gendered perspectives on the Trojan War. More generally, students will come to appreciate the dynamics of legend, and the ways in which a story is adapted to suit localised social, aesthetic, and political agendas.", "title": "Troy Story: Snapshots of an Evolving Legend", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2 or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU3348", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "YCC1112"}
