{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module aims to provide students with a working knowledge of applying\nsimulation techniques to model, simulate and study complex systems. It covers techniques in simulation model design, model execution, and model analysis. Students will have hands-on experience using a simulation package. The module will also introduce concepts of parallel and distributed simulation, and high level architecture.", "title": "Simulation and Modelling Techniques", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "CS4231 and \n(EE2012/A or ST2132 or ST2334 or ((MA2216 or ST2131) and (ST1131/A or ST1232 or DSC2008)))", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS5233", "attributes": {"lab": true, "mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT15", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 110, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-05-04T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": {"and": ["CS4231", {"or": ["EE2012", "EE2012A", "ST2132", "ST2334", {"and": [{"or": ["MA2216", "ST2131"]}, {"or": ["ST1131", "ST1131A", "ST1232", "DSC2008"]}]}]}]}}
