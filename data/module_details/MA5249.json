We investigate Markov chains in both discrete and continuous-time settings. We discuss how to implement one step analysis and derive equations for important quantities such as hitting times. We also discuss how to derive martingales to control the process. Finally, we investigate how does a\nMarkov chain converges to its invariant measure using coupling techniques. These theoretical tools will be applied to design and analyze various stochastic algorithms.", "title": "Stochastic Processes and Algorithms", "department": "Mathematics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "MA2216 or Departmental Approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MA5249", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "MA2216"}
