{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module introduces basic model-making techniques using various material and hands-on processes, and sketching with traditional tools of pen/pencil and paper.\n\nModelling workshops incorporate fundamental form studies through a series of iterations and refinements. Students will develop value judgement while resolving multiple design elements. In addition to the understanding of material\nproperties, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation for precision and finishing. \n\nThrough weekly sketching assignments, students are taught the fundamentals of sketching which include perspective, the concept of drawthrough as well as architecture handwriting.", "title": "Modelling and Sketching for Design", "department": "Industrial Design", "faculty": "Design and Environment", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 6, 0], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "ID1113", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Hybrid_A", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Design Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Hybrid_A", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Design Lecture", "size": 60, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
