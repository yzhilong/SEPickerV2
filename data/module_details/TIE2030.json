Topics include problem solving by computing, writing pseudo-codes, problem formulation and problem solving, program development, coding, testing and debugging, fundamental programming constructs (variables, types, expressions, assignments, functions, control structures, etc.), fundamental data structures: arrays, strings and structures, data processing using large scale data sets from files, visualization, facilitating a design towards solving complex problems. Module will expose both Python and one or more of its variants used for scientific computations such as SciPy and NumPy.", "title": "Programming Methodology with Python", "department": "SCALE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Cont and Lifelong Education", "workload": [3, 1, 1, 0, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "TIE2030", "attributes": {"lab": true, "su": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 90, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 90, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
