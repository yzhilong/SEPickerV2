{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module aims to provide a strong foundation in the study of protein structure and function. The following topics that will be covered: structures and structural complexity of proteins and methods used to determine their primary, secondary and tertiary structures; biological functions of proteins in terms of their regulatory, structural, protective and transport roles; the catalytic action of enzymes, their mechanism of action and regulation; various approaches used in studying the structure-function relationships of proteins.", "title": "Protein Structure and Function", "department": "Biochemistry", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 0.5, 2, 2, 5], "prerequisite": "LSM1106 Molecular Cell Biology or PR1111A Pharmaceutical Biochemistry or PHS1111 Fundamental Biochemistry for Pharmaceutical Science", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LSM3231", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 90, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 90, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 90, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["LSM1106", "PR1111A", "PHS1111"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["LSM4241", "LSM4242", "LSM4229"]}
