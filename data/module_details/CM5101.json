At the outset, students are required to select at least 4 specialized topics to focus on, from: (i) NMR spectroscopy, (ii) Mass spectrometry, (iii) Elemental and thermal analysis, (iv) Chromatography\nand hyphenated techniques, (v) Single crystal and powder X-ray crystallography, (vi) Scanning probe and microscopic techniques. Besides learning the scientific fundamentals through recorded lectures/seminars and\nonline assessments, students work directly with instrumental experts in the various laboratories to gain hands-on knowledge and practical aspects of each of these techniques.", "title": "Advanced Analysis and Characterization Techniques", "department": "Chemistry", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 0, 5, 0, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CM5101", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
