These compromise coastal sustainability, which has serious implications for the well\u2010being of coastal communities, particularly with\nthe added impact of climate change. The more effective management modes to improve coastal resilience take into consideration the biophysical, socio\u2010economic, cultural and governance aspects but implementation remains a challenge.
