{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "MST5002", "description": "MLE5002 is a core module that teaches modern techniques and methods for the structural and spectroscopic characterisation of materials. Besides X-ray-, electron-, and vibrational spectroscopy, the module focuses on different types of microscopy, electron microscopy in particular. The concepts are treated from a mechanistic point of view; letting the students gain deeper insight into the ideas behind the techniques, without the need to perform advanced calculations.  This module is designed to help students select the most relevant microscopy or spectroscopy methods, and let them interact knowledgeably with equipment experts to optimize their own future materials characterisation experiments.", "title": "Materials Characterization", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MLE5002", "attributes": {"grsu": true, "lab": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 70, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2021-05-06T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}]}
