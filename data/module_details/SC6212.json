{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "SC6211A", "description": "This seminar will examine the complexities and the challenges to global social order and peace. With global transformation and the emergence of an interdependent world society, there has been a proliferation of risks. From ecological crises to the intensification of poverty, social inequality and social exclusion to the conflicts and violence on ethnic and religious lines have made the world a risky place. Theories of globalization will be applied to examine the social contexts and consequences of these crises, risks and violence. Globalization will be viewed as a complex process of cultural clashes intersecting with modern economy and polity. Using an inter-disciplinary framework, the seminar will explore the possibilities of minimizing risks and violence in a new global social order.", "title": "Global Transformations", "department": "Sociology", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SC6212", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": []}
