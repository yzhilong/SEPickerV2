{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course introduces students to the gendered dimensions of international development. It examines challenges facing developing countries through the lens of gender, recognizing that the benefits of development may not be shared equally across genders. We read works by scholars representing different nationalities, ethnicities/races, and academic disciplines because this diversity is critical to understanding the economic, political, and cultural contexts around the world in which development policies are implemented. The topics covered include poverty, health, education, agriculture, environment, formal/informal work, migration, the NGO sector, political participation, and development policy.", "title": "Gender and International Development", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "YSS3231 Methods in the Social Sciences, YSS2211 Econometrics and YSS1203 Principles of Economics or with the permission of the instructor. \n(All recommended courses).", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS3316", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1930", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-PgRm1", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "1930", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-PgRm1", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-05-03T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 180}], "prereqTree": {"and": [{"or": ["YSS3231", "YSS2211"]}, "YSS1203"]}}
