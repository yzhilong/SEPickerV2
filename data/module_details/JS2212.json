It aims to develop an awareness not only of the different literary genres and literary theories, but also of the aspirations and frustrations of post-war writers as they struggled to reconcile the Japanese tradition with the Western impact.

Writings of contemporary women writers will also be read.", "title": "Introduction to Japanese Literature", "department": "Japanese Studies", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "JS2212", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 30, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
