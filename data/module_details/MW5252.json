{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "Scientists around the world consistently list achieving tangible impacts on policy and practice as a core career goal - yet few have the knowledge or skillset needed for turning this into a reality. This has arisen because traditional scientific training programs rarely teach the skill set and competencies required to operate effectively at this interface. Thus, this course focuses on providing students with the theory, as well as the practical knowledge, skills and tools that are needed to operate more effectively at the science-policy-practice interface to achieve tangible impacts from their research. This will be achieved by drawing on current research from the fields of knowledge exchange and research impact, as well as the inclusion of guest lecturers from the realms of policy and practice so that students gain a first hand account of the practical ways in which they can bridge the gap between science, policy and practice.", "title": "Engagement for Policy Impact", "department": "FoS Dean's Office", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [4.5, 0, 0, 0, 8], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "MW5252", "semesterData": []}
