{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "TCN4242", "description": "Students will learn the basic theories, methods and software for formulating and solving optimization problems relevant to chemical processes. They will study various methods of linear, nonlinear and mixed-integer linear programming, which would enable them to select and use appropriate algorithm and/or software for solving a given problem. They will also execute the various steps in optimization by solving selected practical problems via various case studies as well as a term project. This is for undergraduate students who wish to learn optimization \nmethodology to solve real-life problems in research and chemical industry.", "title": "Optimization of Chemical Processes", "department": "SCALE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Cont and Lifelong Education", "workload": [3, 0.5, 0, 4, 2.5], "prerequisite": "TC2411, CN3421E", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CN4242E", "aliases": ["TCN4242"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E5-03-21", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 5, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E5-03-21", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 5, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["TC2411", "CN3421E"]}}
