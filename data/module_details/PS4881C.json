Attention is given to corporatist, neo-corporatist and pluralist forms of labour politics and to some of the ways labour enters the political system: for example, as autonomous, state or party-dependent, nondependent party-affiliated, pressure group, social movement or unorganized activity. Issues of format, scope, and participation in collective bargaining will be addressed, as will principal-agent and other collective action logics.", "title": "Topics in CP: Labour Politics", "department": "Political Science", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2, 7.5], "prerequisite": "Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "PS4881C", "semesterData": []}
