{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module aims to introduce both engineering and non-engineering students to the historical background, design process and methodology involved in the design of useful consumer and industrial products, systems and services. As the historical development of design is traced, key principles of design are highlighted. These principles are then described and discussed in greater detail. For the application to problems, students will be working in small groups, interacting with faculty and research staff in an active laboratory where they would be required to think critically and implement solutions to a given \u201cgrand challenge\u201d in an integrated way. The grand challenges\u201d could be everyday problems such as to design a portable kit for making river/sea water drinkable. The final grade will be based on 100% continuous assessment involving assignments, laboratory work and projects.", "title": "Engineering by Design - Devices and Systems", "department": "FoE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [1, 0, 3, 3, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GEM1505A", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
