{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The aim of this course is to provide students with the ability to model, simulate and analyse complex systems in a reasonable time. This course is divided into three parts and covers advanced techniques in simulation model design, model execution, and model analysis. A selection of model design techniques such as conceptual models, declarative models, functional models, constraint models, and multi-models will be discussed. Model execution techniques include discussion of serial and parallel discrete-event simulation algorithms. For model analysis, topics include input-output analysis, variance reduction techniques and experimental design.", "title": "Advanced Modelling & Simulation", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "CS3232 or CS4237", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS6205", "attributes": {"lab": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"or": ["CS3232", "CS4237"]}}
