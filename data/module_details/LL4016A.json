{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "When the judges at the Nuremberg Tribunal handed down their decision against the German leaders in October 1946, they declared \u2018crimes against peace\u2019 \u2013 the initiation of aggressive wars \u2013 to be \u2018the supreme international\ncrime\u2019. At the time, the charge was heralded as a legal milestone, but subsequent events revealed it to be a postwar anomaly. This module traces the ebb and flow of the idea of criminalising aggression \u2013 from its origins after the\nFirst World War, through its high-water mark at the postwar tribunals and its abandonment during the Cold War, to its recent revival at the International Criminal Court.", "title": "Topics in Int\u2019l Criminal Law (A): Aggression", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or its equivalent", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LL4016A", "semesterData": []}
