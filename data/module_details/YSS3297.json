{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module investigates the hypothesis that urbanism does not necessarily mean ecological failure but can be understood as bringing the natural and the cultural into new relationships. The course will introduce students to the history of the \u201cgreen\u201d city as a concept, using case studies from Renaissance urban design to the \u201ceco-city\u201d of Masdar in Abu Dhabi. Using Singapore as a site for field study, students will explore how anthropogenic factors (species introduction, hardscapes, designed landscape, and waste) give rise to new ecological conditions. Urban issues such as biodiversity, Heat Island Effect, and ecosystem services will also be considered.", "title": "\u201cGreen\u201d Cities and Urban Natures", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [1, 2, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.", "corequisite": "YSSS2220 Adelaide to Zhuhai: Cities in Comparative Perspective or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSS3297", "attributes": {"mpes1": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UTSRC-LT53", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 22, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": "YCC2121"}
