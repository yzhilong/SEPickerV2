{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "TC2411", "description": "This module introduces basic concepts of developing mathematical models for Chemical Engineering systems and trains students on techniques for solving the resulting differential equations and applying vector algebra and calculus. The objective is to provide mathematical foundations for solution of complex Chemical Engineering problems. This module is to be driven from Chemical Engineering systems perspective and expose students to methodology to identify appropriate simplifications in system modeling that lead to simplified mathematical description from a more comprehensive one. The module develops methods for solving order differential equations, partial differential equations as well as handling vector operations in Chemical Engineering systems.", "title": "Mathematics for Chemical Engineers 2", "department": "SCALE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Cont and Lifelong Education", "workload": [2.5, 1, 0, 2, 4.5], "prerequisite": "TTG1401 Engineering Mathematics I", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "TCN2411", "aliases": ["TC2411"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 3, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-12", "end": "2021-07-07"}, "venue": "EA-06-02", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-12", "end": "2021-07-07"}, "venue": "EA-06-02", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-10", "end": "2021-06-21", "weekInterval": 2}, "venue": "EA-06-02", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-10", "end": "2021-06-21", "weekInterval": 2}, "venue": "EA-06-02", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 40, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-07-10T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": "TTG1401", "fulfillRequirements": ["TCN4242", "TCN2122", "TCN3121"]}
