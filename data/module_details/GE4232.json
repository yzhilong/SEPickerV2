Global political ecologies will examine environmental issues that have explicit global impact.

Drawing on the theoretical underpinnings of political ecology and case studies around the world, this module will explore themes such as: environmental ideology and discourse; politics and livelihoods; energy and natural resource management; production and consumption of food, nature conservation and climate change.", "title": "Global Political Ecologies", "department": "Geography", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3.5, 6], "prerequisite": "Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GE with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track\n\n(BES students from both specialisations).\nCompleted 80 MCs of NUS modules before they can read any level-4000 GE modules.
