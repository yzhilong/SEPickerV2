{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module like others in the Writing and Critical Thinking area helps students become better writers of argumentative essays. To do this, we will specifically examine the modern phenomenon that is tourism, asking questions such as: What is a tourist? Why do we become tourists? Why do we send postcards, take photographs, or collect souvenirs? Do tourists find ourselves when we go abroad? Do we lose ourselves? How are cultures packaged for tourists, and is this packaging always reductive? Such questions will help us to understand the assumptions behind tourism, and to explore issues of modernity, nationality, self and other, identity and culture.", "title": "Writing & Critical Thinking: Sites of Tourism", "department": "University Scholars Programme", "faculty": "University Scholars Programme", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 0, 6], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UWC2101J", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "USP-TR1", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 12, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "USP-TR1", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 12, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "USP-TR1", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 12, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "2", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "USP-TR1", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 12, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
