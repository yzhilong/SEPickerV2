Head's and/or Graduate Coordinator's approval is required. Regular meetings and reports are expected. Evaluation is based on 100% Continuous Assessment and must be worked out between the student and the lecturer prior to seeking departmental approval.", "title": "Independent Study", "department": "Sociology", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 0, 0, 0, 10], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SC6660", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}, {"semester": 3, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}, {"semester": 4, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}]}
