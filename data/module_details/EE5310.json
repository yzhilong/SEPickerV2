{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "EE6310 Communication Networking Fundamentals (Advanced)", "description": "This course introduces students to the fundamental principles and concepts of computer communication networks. The course covers four main layers of the\nnetwork protocol stack: link, network, transport and application. The fundamental design principles of each layer are presented. Issues related to the performance of each layer are explored in detail. The course uses case studies to expose students to real-world networking protocols and presents the design principles that motivated the development of these protocols. The course also includes an examination of the security aspects of each layer.", "title": "Communication Networking Fundamentals", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 2, 5], "prerequisite": "[applicable to UG level students only] EE2012 or EE2012A or ST2334 or EE3204 or EE4204 or EE4210; or\n\n[Advisory pre-req applicable to GD level students only] Requires basic probability at the level of EE2012/EE2012A/ST234 and basic networking concepts at the level of EE3204/EE4204 and EE4210", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE5310", "attributes": {"grsu": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": {"and": [{"or": ["EE2012", "EE2012A", "ST2334", "EE3204", "EE4204", "EE4210"]}, "EE4210"]}}
