{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "YSC3221 Computer Vision and Deep Learning", "description": "Computer vision is Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on images and video as the input. The goal of computer vision is to extract information from images and video., It isattempts to make computers work like human's eyes:, namely, to understand and recognize the world through visual data. Compared to other types of data, extracting information from images and video is more complex. However, it has been shown that DEEP LEARNING is effective in addressing this problem. Thus, in this course, we also learn deep learning, particularly in the context of solving computer vision problems.", "title": "Computer Vision and Deep Learning", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "Programming skill in Python, Strong knowledge in mathematics (linear algebra, calculus, probability) and YSC2232 Linear Algebra, or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC3221", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "YSC2232"}
