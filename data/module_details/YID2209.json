{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "To better understand the effects humans are having on the Earth, this course explores how the Earth functions as a complex system with a solid lithosphere interacting with an atmosphere and hydrosphere in a way that sustains the biosphere. We investigate how these different spheres interact, and how scientists measure the changes in these realms. Topics include the theory of plate tectonics, the dynamics of atmospheric circulation, and the fundamentals of biogeochemical cycling as the foundation of ecosystems. Students will engage in data collection and analysis, and compare their analyses to current knowledge as documented in the scientific literature.", "title": "Biogeophysical Systems", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [1, 2, 0, 3, 6.5], "prerequisite": "YID1201 Introduction to Environmental Studies or with the permission of instructor.", "corequisite": "YID1201 Introduction to Environmental Studies or with the permission of instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YID2209", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "YID1201"}
