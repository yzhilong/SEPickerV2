{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "To provide a working understanding of basic problems of mechanobiology. In practical terms, we will present to the students a number of important problems relevant to force-generation and force-sensing in living systems, and how the cells interpret the mechanical cues for regulation of their functions. The teaching will primarily involved the discussion of the studies that are performed at MBI and reading original literatures under the guidance of MBI investigators. The \nassignment will involve writing of several science features devoted to the studies conducted at MBI, 1 mini-review devoted to selected mechanobiology field analysed indepth and an oral presentation of the mini-review in class.", "title": "Topics in Mechanobiology", "department": "Mechanobiology Institute (MBI)", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [0, 2, 0, 3, 5], "prerequisite": "Basic Physical Chemistry, Calculus, Biology, Graduate\nstanding, MB5101 or approval of the module coordinator.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "MB5102", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [], "covidZones": []}], "prereqTree": "MB5101"}
