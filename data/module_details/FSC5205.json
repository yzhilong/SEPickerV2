{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "In recent years, Singapore courts have increasingly relied on forensic evidence, which is considered objective and corroborative of other evidence as compared to the testimony of eyewitnesses and confessions of accused persons, which have at times proved to be unreliable. Forensic evidence also plays a very important role in the assessment of sufficiency of evidence in major cases in Singapore. This module serves the capstone role in which students utilise knowledge and skills gained in preceding forensic science modules to conduct in-depth analysis of\nmajor cases in Singapore such as murders and rape, and appreciate how forensic science had decisively shaped the outcome of these cases.", "title": "Forensic Science in Major Cases", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 2, 0, 3, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "FSC5205", "attributes": {"ssgf": true}, "semesterData": []}
