{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module approaches science as a mode of thinking and a process of knowing; and examines how the thinking and process generated narratives (stories) about our natural world, life and ourselves. It also explores other controversial and darker narratives of pseudoscience and fraudulent science that arose from the deviation and the misuse/abuse of the thinking and the process of science. It highlights how these narratives ignited imaginations and aroused ethical and societal concerns. Students will learn how science through its thinking and process have generated narratives, and in turn how these narratives have\nchanged our thinking and beyond.", "title": "Science: From Thinking to Narratives", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [4, 0, 0, 4, 2], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GET1048", "attributes": {"mpes1": true, "mpes2": true, "su": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 100, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 100, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}, {"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 100, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_B", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 100, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
