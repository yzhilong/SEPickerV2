{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course will cover density functional theory and its variants for many-particle\nsystems (electrons in atoms, molecules, solids; ultracold atoms in traps and optical\nlattices) from the perspective of theoretical and mathematical physics and will also\ndeal with applications and the intricacies of numerical implementations. A central\ncomponent of the module are the lectures given during the IMS Programme on\nDensity Functionals for Many-Particle Systems (2-27 September 2019).", "title": "Density Functionals for Many-Particle Systems", "department": "Center for Quantum Technologies", "faculty": "NUS Graduate School", "workload": [4, 1, 0, 3, 2], "prerequisite": "This module is open to all students at CQT, and to those in Physics, Mathematics,\nand Chemistry.
