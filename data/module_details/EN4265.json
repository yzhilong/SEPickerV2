{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The new millennium has witnessed a return to realism in literature, criticism, and popular culture.

These developments suggest that canonical modernisms of the early twentieth-century prescribed, and so constrained, critical approaches to literatures of the postcolony. Focusing on the resurgent value of postcolonial realism for our current globalist conjuncture, the module entertains theoretical exchanges between World Literature, Postcolonial Studies, and the Frankfurt School\u2019s Marxism.", "title": "Approaches to World Literature: Critical Realism", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 9.5], "prerequisite": "Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN or 28 MCs in EU/LA (French/ German/Spanish)/recognised modules or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN or 28 MCs in EU/LA (French/ German/Spanish)/recognised modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "EN4265", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 40, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
