Specific topics include linear, integer, and non-linear programming, transportation and network modelling, constrained optimization, decision making under uncertainty and probabilistic modelling.  Emphasis will be placed on practical methods for solving optimization problems using standard computational tools and packages.", "title": "Modelling and Optimization", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 5, 4.5], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC2254", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1100", "endTime": "1230", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-TCTLT", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1100", "endTime": "1230", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-TCTLT", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-05-06T01:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 180}]}
