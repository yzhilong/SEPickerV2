Emotions are complex, multiply-determined states that influence our experiences, biochemistry, thinking, actions, relationships, motivations, and behaviours, as well as our health. Topics to be covered in this module include 'what is the nature of emotion?', 'what functions, if any, do specific emotions serve?', 'what are their antecedents and their consequences?', among others.
