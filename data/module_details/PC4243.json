{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The objective of this module is to provide students with a background to the important developments in atomic physics over the last 30 years that have now become standard techniques utilized in many laboratories around the world. The lectures provide a detailed description of the interaction of atoms with electromagnetic fields and applies this analysis to a number of applications such as laser spectroscopy, laser cooling, and magnetic and optical trapping. The course will provide students with a comprehensive background to the tools of modern atomic physics", "title": "Atomic & Molecular Physics II", "department": "Physics", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 1, 5], "prerequisite": "PC3233", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PC4243", "attributes": {"mpes2": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT34", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT34", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"], "examDate": "2021-04-26T09:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": "PC3233", "fulfillRequirements": ["QT5201F"]}
