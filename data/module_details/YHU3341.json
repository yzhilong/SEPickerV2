{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course will introduce students to the work of modern and contemporary artists whose work has been shaped by, or produced in, response to the aftermath of colonialism. Focusing specifically on art production in South and Southeast Asia, Africa, the West Indies and Caribbean, Australia, and the work of diaspora artists, the readings will also address the limited scope of the art historical canon, the prevalence of Eurocentrism, and the challenges of presenting the art world as global. The course will also include the discussion and application of postcolonial literary theory, namely the work of Homi K. Bhabha, to deepen our understanding and aid in our interpretation of postcolonial artworks (painting, sculpture, film, photography, video art and installations) produced from the 1950s to the present.", "title": "Postcolonial Art", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 1.5, 8], "prerequisite": "One 2000 level Arts and Humanities module or with the permission of the instructor.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU3341", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UTSRC-GLR", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown", "A"]}]}
