Techniques for discrete-time control realization will also be discussed. After attending the course, the students will acquire the basic skills on designing simple controllers for real time systems, know how to analyze the system responses and evaluate the controller performance. The topics covered are: discrete system analysis; pole-placement design, basic predictive control, digital PID controllers; implementation issues (sampling theorem, aliasing, discretization errors) and real-time realization using system control software such as Matlab and Labview.", "title": "Computer Control Systems", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "[Applicable to UG level students only] EE2023 or EE3331C or ME2142; or\n\n[Advisory applicable to GD level students only] Requires background knowledge such as EE2010, EE2023, EE3331C, ME2142 or equivalent.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE5103", "attributes": {"grsu": true, "mpes1": true}, "aliases": ["ME5403"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_A", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 80, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"], "examDate": "2020-11-25T05:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 150}], "prereqTree": {"or": ["EE2023", "EE3331C", "ME2142", "EE2010"]}, "fulfillRequirements": ["EE5201", "EE6105", "EE6701", "EE6201"]}
