{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This course is primarily concerned with the age-old dichotomy between law in the law books and law in action. Through the examination of the origin, function and pattern of law in primitive and modern societies from a historical, anthropological and sociological perspective, we will try to understand better, the constraints under which \u2018law\u2019 in modern society operates, and the limits on the use of law as an instrument of social change. \n\nIn the first part of the course, the student will be introduced to basic ideas in classical anthropology and the sociology of law. Questions such as - Are there any \u2018universal\u2019 patterns of human behaviour? To what extent is a society\u2019s perception of law influenced or controlled by environmental and econological factors? How are disputes resolved? Is aggression and warfare inherent in the human condition? - will be dealt with. In the second part of the course, these anthropological methods will be applied to a study of the concept of law in diverse societies from a sociological perspective, and to the actual function of law in \nsociety. Do patterns of human behaviour discernable in primitive societies hold true in more complex \u2018modern\u2019 societies? What are the attributes of a \u2018modern\u2019 legal system? Is the concept of \u2018law\u2019 in the western sense inevitable and universal in all kinds of societies. What happens to the concept of law in plural societies? \n\nTeaching will be by seminars which will include lectures and discussion of assigned readings. No previous knowledge of law anthropology or sociology is required or will be assumed of students.", "title": "Law & Society", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LL4146", "semesterData": []}
