{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The objective of this module is to introduce students to the various issues that arise in securing the networks, and study the state-of-the-art techniques for addressing these challenges. A number of most damaging attacks on computer systems involve the exploitation of network infrastructure. This module provides an in-depth study of network attack techniques and methods to defend against them. Topics include basic concepts in network security; firewalls and virtual private networks; network intrusion detection; denial of service (DoS); traffic analysis; secure routing protocols; protocol scrubbing; and advanced topics such as wireless network security.", "title": "Network Security", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 0, 0, 6, 2], "prerequisite": "CS3235 Computer Security", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS5321", "attributes": {"lab": true, "mpes2": true, "ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1830", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 110, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}], "prereqTree": "CS3235", "fulfillRequirements": ["CS6230"]}
