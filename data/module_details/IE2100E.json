The\nemphasis of this course will be on model formulation and probabilistic analysis. Students will eventually be conversant\nwith the properties of these models and appreciate their roles in engineering applications.", "title": "Probability Models with Applications", "department": "SCALE Dean's Office", "faculty": "Cont and Lifelong Education", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 3, 3], "corequisite": "ST2131 or TS2120 or IE2120E", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "IE2100E", "attributes": {"su": true}, "aliases": ["TIE2100"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2030", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UTSRC-LT51", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "2030", "endTime": "2130", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "UTSRC-LT51", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 20, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "fulfillRequirements": ["IE4239E"]}
