{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "MP5136", "description": "This course is concerned with the economic analysis of the public sector and how government policies affect the economy. It covers topics in state capacity development, tax and fiscal policies, and public good provision. The approach in this course is analytical rather than descriptive, with a focus on recent topical issues, such as tax evasion and avoidance, tax competition, and public debt sustainability. There are no formal prerequisites, but students will be expected to reason based on graphical representations of economic models, and link empirical economic research to policy. Practical policy implications will be at the forefront throughout.", "title": "Applied Public Sector Economics", "department": "LKYSPP Dean's Office", "faculty": "LKY School of Public Policy", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 4, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PP5136", "semesterData": [{"semester": 3, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-11", "end": "2021-06-15"}, "venue": "E-Learn_D", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-20", "end": "2021-06-17"}, "venue": "E-Learn_D", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-14", "end": "2021-05-14"}, "venue": "E-Learn_D", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 25, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
