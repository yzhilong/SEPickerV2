Masters and Ph.D. students who specialise in international relations will be required to read this module. The module will introduce to students important and influential theories on international relations, including realism and liberalism, that attempt to explain cooperation and conflict among nations. Students will also be exposed to some of the important methods of analysis - such as case studies, formal modeling, and statistical analysis - that help distinguish the current study of international relations from that of previous eras. Important approaches, such as constructivism and rational choice, will also be discussed. Under the instructor's guidance, students will undertake an academic-quality presentation to the class and write a paper which proposes in detail an original research project in international relations.", "title": "Seminar in International Relations", "department": "Political Science", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 2, 5], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "PS5314", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1800", "endTime": "2100", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "E-Learn_C", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 20, "covidZone": "Unknown"}], "covidZones": ["Unknown"]}]}
