It continues the introduction that begins in CS1010, and emphasises objectoriented programming with application to simple data structures. Topics include object-oriented problem modeling with objects, classes and methods, object-oriented problem formulation and solving, data structure implementation strageties, abstraction and encapsulation of data structures, object-oriented programming constructs, APIs and class libraries, exception handling, lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables and their algorithmic design, sorting and searching methods, recursive algorithms, and Big-O notation. This module is appropriate for SoC and FoS students.", "title": "Data Structures and Algorithms I", "department": "Computer Science", "faculty": "Computing", "workload": [2, 1, 1, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "CS1010 Programming Methodology", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "CS1020", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "CS1010", "fulfillRequirements": ["CS2102", "CS2103", "CS2104", "CS2105", "CS2220", "CS3221", "CS3240", "CS4243", "CS5239", "CS5240", "CS5241", "CS5249", "CS2010", "CS2102R", "CS2103T", "CS3218", "CS2108", "IS2103", "IS2102", "IS2150", "BT3102", "IS3261", "IS4302", "CG2271"]}
