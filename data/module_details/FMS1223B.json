As a result, the average Singapore resident is more familiar with plants from other parts of the world but not Singapore, which is a great shame. Native plants provide many ecosystem services for humans and ecological functions for native organisms. This module will help students appreciate the native flora and the importance of its conservation and sustainability. In addition, students will acquire basic botanical knowledge, the rudiments of plant identification and classification, as well as scientific reporting and presentation skills.", "title": "The Native Seed Plants of Singapore", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [0, 2, 0, 4, 4], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "FMS1223B", "semesterData": []}
