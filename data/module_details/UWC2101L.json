Is happiness in our own control or does it depend on external circumstances, such as wealth or freedom? Are pleasure or virtue necessary or even sufficient conditions of happiness? What constitutes a meaningful life, and how is meaning related to happiness? To reflect on such questions, we will investigate the arguments of philosophers, psychologists, economists, and other thinkers over the course of three thematic units.", "title": "Writing and Critical Thinking: Conditions of Happiness", "department": "University Scholars Programme", "faculty": "University Scholars Programme", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 0, 6], "prerequisite": "Not applicable to USP modules.", "corequisite": "Not applicable to USP modules.", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UWC2101L", "semesterData": []}
