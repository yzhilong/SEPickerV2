{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The aim of this course is to give an overview of Bayesian parametric modelling. Students will learn how to specify a Bayesian parametric model and compute posterior distributions. They will be able to perform inference (point and interval estimation and test) in a Bayesian framework. By the end of the course students will be able to solve simple data analysis problems in a Bayesian framework, employing, for example, regression and model choice techniques. They will also be able to implement these models using statistical software (R and OpenBugs), and write reports for their analysis.", "title": "Bayesian Statistics", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 2, 2.5, 4, 4], "prerequisite": "YSC2230 Probability and Statistics or with the permission of the instructor", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YSC3243", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "YSC2230"}
