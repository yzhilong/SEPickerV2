We will thus examine the representation of Singapore, and of contemporary issues of importance in Singapore, in a variety of different popular media. After an initial introduction to the critical reading of cultural representation, we will explore traditional genres such as poetry and drama, as well as more popular ones such as television, film, and popular autobiography. The module is open to all students.", "title": "Representing Singapore", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 0, 7], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SSA1206", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}
