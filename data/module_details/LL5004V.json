Topics to be discussed include the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, bilateral services agreements, aircraft safety, terrorism and aviation security and carrier liability for death or injury to passengers. Competition among airlines will also be analysed, including business strategies such as code-sharing, frequent flier schemes and alliances.
