{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The module explores in depth a particular Southeast Asian art (visual or performing arts, music, or literature).The specific focus of the module varies (to be announced). Students are introduced to theoretical approaches relevant to the topic, in the context of larger theoretical frameworks (historical, anthropological, etc.) of the study of Southeast Asian arts; and they have a chance to experience the art directly by studying the basics of the artistic practice (e.g., learning to paint, play music, dance). The module emphasizes both an in-depth study of the art and the relevance of such study for broader understanding of Southeast Asia.", "title": "Studies in Southeast Asian Arts", "department": "Southeast Asian Studies", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 4, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SE3210", "semesterData": []}
