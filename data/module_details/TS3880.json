Students are guided in\n\nthe theoretical parameters and issues, project\n\nmethodology, and development of the practical\n\nwork. Through an individual role, each student\n\nconsiders how their practical experience and\n\nknowledge in local contexts interact with theory\n\nand methodology. The module extends over\n\nboth semesters of one academic year to\n\nfacilitate the longer-term growth of practice\n\nresearch outcomes. Admission is by portfolio\n\nsubmission and interviews / auditions.", "title": "Topics in Group Practice Research", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 3, 4], "prerequisite": "TS1101E", "moduleCredit": "8", "moduleCode": "TS3880", "semesterData": [], "prereqTree": "TS1101E"}
