{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The ocean covers 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface and, through its interaction\nwith the atmosphere, plays a key role in Earth\u2019s climate. This course\nexplores how marine ecosystems respond to, and play a role in, climate\nvariability. We will examine factors regulating oceanic productivity,\nincluding how large-scale, coupled oceanographic/atmospheric\nprocesses, such as El Ni\u00f1o and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, affect food\nwebs from plankton to commercially-harvested fish. This course will also\nlook at the influence of anthropogenic climate change on the stability\nand productivity of marine ecosystems.", "title": "Effects of Climate on Marine Ecosystems", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 12, 0, 0, 24], "moduleCredit": "1", "moduleCode": "YSH2428", "semesterData": []}
