{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "This module  is  the  second  part of  a  two-part  module designed    to    provide    first    year    Chemical    and Biomolecular Engineering students with an experiential exposure to the foundational concepts of Biomolecular/Biochemical/Bioprocess Engineering, including mass  and  energy  balances,  biosafety  and sterile handling, bioreaction kinetics, bioreactor design, downstream  processing  and  purification,  biosystems modelling  and  optimization,  etc.,  through  a  series  of hands-on  experimental laboratories. In  the  laboratory, they   will   learn   to   carry   out   measurement,   data collection,    analysis,    modelling, interpretation    and presentation.  The  laboratory  sessions  will  be  blended with  real  engineering  applications  of  industrial  and societal relevance to Singapore\n.", "title": "Chemical Engineering Principles and Practice II", "department": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": "2-3-4-2-1-3", "moduleCredit": "6", "moduleCode": "CN1102", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": [], "fulfillRequirements": ["CN4233R"]}
