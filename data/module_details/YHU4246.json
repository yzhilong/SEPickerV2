{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "description": "The individual and the social body are intimately connected through the faculty of reproduction. Sexual matters are therefore inevitably and intensely political. The growing administration \u2013 or biopolitics \u2013 of the gendered body, of the family as the primary unit of reproduction, and of entire populations and \u2018races\u2019 has been designated a defining threshold of \u2018modernity\u2019. This course will first trace the history of biopolitics and then explore how biopolitics and geopolitics have become steadily more entangled in the 20th and 21st centuries through issues as wide-ranging as ecology, sustainability, development, migration, post-colonialism, religion, governmentality and human rights.", "title": "The Population Bomb: Biopolitics & Geopolitics", "department": "Yale-NUS College", "faculty": "Yale-NUS College", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 1, 8.5], "prerequisite": "Non-history majors should have already taken their HI module. \nStudents who have previously taken YHU3318: Sexuality in Modern Europe and Its Empires would be familiar with several of the issues explored.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "YHU4246", "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-LT1", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1600", "endTime": "1730", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "Y-LT1", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 18, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}], "prereqTree": "YHU3318"}
