It focuses on the engineering principles and practice of how computer-aided systems are designed and built.\n\nThey are first taught the fundamental principles of electronic circuits through laboratory sessions and group discussions. They are then guided to apply these principles to build a sensor-assisted autonomous robotic vehicle. Upon completing the module, they can appreciate the importance of circuits, signals, and sensors in system implementation.\n\nThis module is only for high school students.", "title": "Electrical & Computer Engineering Principles & Practice", "department": "Electrical and Computer Engineering", "faculty": "Engineering", "workload": [0, 0, 3, 0, 2], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "EE1111B", "attributes": {"year": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 3, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-10", "end": "2021-06-14"}, "venue": "E4A-06-07", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-14", "end": "2021-06-18"}, "venue": "E4A-06-07", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-13", "end": "2021-06-17"}, "venue": "E4A-06-07", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1700", "weeks": {"start": "2021-05-12", "end": "2021-06-16"}, "venue": "E4A-06-07", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Laboratory", "size": 50, "covidZone": "A"}], "covidZones": ["A"]}]}
