{"acadYear": "2020/2021", "preclusion": "LL4389/LL5389/LL6389 Asset-Based Financing: Quasi-Security Devices", "description": "This course critically examines so-called \u2018quasi-security\u2019 devices: legal structures that perform the function of personal property security, whilst not being \u2018true\u2019 security in the legal sense. These devices entail the retention of title or absolute\ntransfer of title (rather than the grant of a security interest) and, like \u2018true\u2019 security, secure the performance of an obligation. Hence, consideration will be given to retention of title devices (ROT or \u2018Romapla\u2019 clauses) in the supply of goods to manufacturers or to retailers as stock-in-trade, conditional-sale, hire-purchase, finance-leasing. Absolute transfer of title devices exemplified by receivables financing (factoring, securitisation) will also be covered.", "title": "Asset-Based Financing: Quasi-Security Devices", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "workload": [0, 3, 0, 0, 7], "prerequisite": "NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "LL6389V", "semesterData": []}
